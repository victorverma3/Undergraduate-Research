Anna Laura Maloy, M.D., Case No. 2013-00659  NOTICE OF RIGHTS  Respondent has the right to request a hearing to be conducted in accordance with Section 120.569 and 120.57, Florida Statutes, to be represented by counsel or other qualified representative, to present evidence and argument, to call and cross-examine witnesses and to have subpoena and subpoena duces tecum issued on his or her behalf if a hearing is requested.  NOTICE REGARDING ASSESSMENT OF COSTS  Respondent is placed on notice that Petitioner has incurred costs related to the investigation and prosecution of this matter. Pursuant to Section 456.072(4), Florida Statutes, the Board shall assess costs related to the investigation and prosecution of a disciplinary matter, which may include attorney hours and costs, on the Respondent in addition to any other discipline imposed.  DOH v. Anna Laura Maloy, M.D. DOH Case No. 2013-00659 4, Respondent is board certified in Emergency Medicine by the American Board of Emergency Medicine.  5. On February 15, 2011, Patient BD, a 49 year-old female, presented to St. Lucie Emergency Department (Hospital ED) with shortness of breath and a cough. Another doctor diagnosed BD with pneumonia, administered nebulizer treatments, and released her home with oral antibiotics.  6. On February 22, 2011, BD presented to Physicians Immediate Care, an emergency walk in clinic (Clinic). Her complaint was right side pain/tightness and acute shortness of breath. Her vital signs were BP 160/96; P: 121; R: 16; T 98.6; O2 saturation: 87%.  7. The Clinic doctor made the following entries in his records  we - : under. the heading of treatment: “With pt. oxygen status and SOB, cP it is  es ; posable a PE [pulmonary embolism] could have been thrown. Needs to go  | to ER.” The Clinic doctor ordered that BD be continuously monitored by clinic staff until EMS arrived to transport her to the Emergency Department.  8. The St. Lucie County Fire District Rescue Unit responded to the Clinic and transported BD to the Hospital ED, which took approximately 20  minutes. The EMS documentation contains the following entries: “Noted  DOH v. Anna Laura Maloy, M.D. 2 DOH Case No. 2013-00659  respiratory wheezing in all fields. When patient was removed from the 02, the pts 02 sat dropped down to 86. r/o [Rule out] pulmonary embolism. ER contacted without questions or orders. Written and verbal report given to ER staff.” The documentation contained the following vital signs: “Pulse 102; Resp: 22; Respiratory effort; Labored; SaO2: 86% (on room air).”  9. The triage records at the Hospital ED document the vital signs as BP: 159/90; HR: 98; T 98.8; SpO2%: 88.  10. Respondent was the ED doctor assigned to evaluate and treat BD on February 22, 2011. In performing her evaluation, she used a “Shortness of Breath” chief complaint-driven template from Xpress Technologies.  11. Respondent relied on the vital signs taken at triage and  AB recorded no. vital signs as Part of her physical examination of BD. The  my history and physical information that Respondent entered consisted of the . following: “48y [female] with cough, fever, flu x 1-2 weeks. Treated w/ Z- pak, initially, better, now symptoms have returned, cough productive, scant sputum... .” She notes that BD “can’t get enough air.”  12. Respondent ordered a portable chest x-ray which was interpreted as “No acute cardiac or pulmonary pathology. The apparent  lingular infiltrate seen on 02/15/11 has resolved.” Respondent also  DOH v. Anna Laura Maloy, M.D. 3 DOH Case No. 2013-00659  ordered blood work, one of which was significant for a potassium level of 2.8. Achest x-ray is non-diagnostic for a pulmonary embolism.  13. The Respondent treated BD with two IV antibiotics and oral potassium chloride to treat Respondent’s diagnosis of “Cough; Hypokalemia; Bronchitis.” Respondent also prescribed potassium chloride tablets and antibiotic tablets. She then discharged BD.  14. On March 3, 2011, BD died from a saddle pulmonary embolism that was focally adherent, meaning the embolus itself was not an acute process.  15. The “Shortness of Breath” chief complaint-driven template from Xpress Technologies that Respondent used to evaluate BD on February 22, 2011, contained a section for “Medical Decision Making” for Differential Diagnostic Considerations. In that section, one differential diagnosis , consideration listed is pulmonary embolus. That is the same differential | diagnosis that BD was sent to the ER with, from the Clinic and by EMS, and no consideration for pulmonary embolism is documented as being entertained.  16. Based on BD's heart rate, labored breathing and low O2 saturation, and in light of the referral from the Clinic to rule out pulmonary  embolism, the standard of care required Respondent to evaluate BD for  DOH v. Anna Laura Maloy, M.D. 4 DOH Case No. 2013-00659 pulmonary embolism, test for embolism by performing a D-dimer test, and  7 ; i document the findings of the examination and the test.  7 17. A D-dimer tests for a fibrin degradation product (or FDP), a small protein fragment present in the blood after a blood clot is degraded by fibrinolysis. While a negative result practically rules out thrombosis, a positive result can indicate thrombosis, but does not rule out other potential causes.  18. By failing to integrate the history and physical findings, and further failing to perform any test(s) that could exclude the possibility of pulmonary embolism, Respondent practiced below the standard of care.  19. If Respondent considered the possibility of pulmonary  . embolism, she failed to document ruling out that diagnosis in the section  ae 2 oft the template that was reserved for. that purpose.  o 20. _ Respondent did not adequately assess BD’s complaints and  ee symptoms an dno complete and proper history and physical examination  was documented.  21. Respondent failed to document acknowledgment of the records from the Clinic and EMS that the reason for transfer was to rule out pulmonary embolism.  DOH v. Anna Laura Maloy, M.D. 5 DOH Case No. 2013-00659 22. Respondent's diagnosis of BD's condition was_ inappropriate, inadequate, inaccurate, and untimely. If Respondent had simply read the ‘Clinic referral documents and attempted to rule out pulmonary embolism by performing the D-dimer test, she would have known whether she needed to proceed with different tests toward a different diagnosis.  23. Respondent’s medical records do not justify the course of treatment. Specifically, the records do not justify the use of antibiotics or the failure to perform the D-dimer test. They do not document the possible differential diagnosis of pulmonary embolism or a complete history or physical examination.  COUNT ONE  24.

Petitioner is the state department charged with regulating the practice of medicine pursuant to Section 20.43, Florida Statutes; Chapter 456, Florida Statutes; and Chapter 458, Florida Statutes.  2. At all times material to this Complaint, Respondent was a licensed medical doctor within the state of Florida, having been issued license number ME 41360.  -3,. Respondent's address of record is 1361 13 Avenue South, Suite 140, Jacksonville Beach, Florida 32250.  4. Respondent is board certified in general surgery.  1578  5. Patient M.Y. (MY), a then-69 year-old female, was admitted through the emergency room to Baptist Medical Center-Beaches on July 16, 2007, with an admitting diagnosis of obstructive jaundice, cholecystitis with cholelithlasis and choledocholithiasis, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension and psoriasis. Respondent was the attending physician.  6. At the time’of admission, MY denied any abdominal pain. She also did not report abdominal pain to any of the consulting physicians.  7. A pre-operative CT scan and an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) were performed. An ERCP is a procedure in which a dye is injected into the bile and pancreatic ducts using a flexible, video endoscope. Then x-rays are taken to outline the bile ducts and pancreas.  | 8. The CT scan and ERCP indicated a mass in the proximal common hepatic duct, which would be consistent with a cholangiocarcinoma causing obstruction. In addition, there was a small stone seen In the distal common bile duct, which was removed by the ERCP along with a sphincterotomy, An intraductal drain was placed beyond the area of potential obstruction such that MY had a source of  internal drainage.  DOH v. Abbas Shariat, M.D.; 2008-08936  1579  - 9, Definitive diagnosis could have been made by follow-up CT scan-guided biopsies. There was no need for urgent cholecystectomy.  10. At the time Respondent was performing the laparoscopic cholecystectomy, he observed multiple small plaques or nodules on the surface of the liver. He elected not to biopsy those to determine if they represented metastatic disease. tad he done so, he could had closed and completed the surgery ‘without performing the unnecessary cholecystectomy.  11. Patient MY suffered an apparent intra-operative injury which Respondent did not recognize. When MY became hypotensive, Respondent should have immediately shifted to an open procedure to determine the source of the bleeding and corrected it. Failing to do so made all the other measures taken post-operatively to resuscitate MY and perform an arteriogram heroic, but doomed.  12. Respondent practiced below the standard of care when he went forward with an unwarranted “urgent” cholecystectomy when it was | unnecessary.  13. Section 458.331(1)(t)1, Florida Statutes (2007), subjects a doctor to discipline for committing medical malpractice as defined in Section 456.50. Section 456.50, Florida Statutes (2007), defines medical  DOH v. Abbas Shariat, M.0.; 2008-08936 3  1580  malpractice as the failure to practice medicine in accordance with the level of care, skill, and treatment recognized in general law related to health care licensure.  14. Level of care, skill, and treatment recognized in general law related to health care licensure means the standard of care specified in Section 766.102. Section 766.102(1), Florida Statutes (2007), defines the standard of care to mean“... : The prevailing professional standard of care for a given health care provider shall be that level of care, skill, and treatment which, in light of all relevant surrounding circumstances, Is recognized as acceptable and appropriate by reasonably prudent similar health care providers. .. .”  15. Respondent failed to meet the prevailing standard of care in one or more of the following ways:  a. By performing an unwarranted “urgent” cholecystectomy when  it was unnecessary;  b. By failing to convert to an open procedure to determine the  source of the bleeding and correct it;  c.. By falling to biopsy liver plaques or nodules and then terminate  the procedure once he had begun performing it.  DOH v. Abbas Shariat, M.D.; 2008-08936  1581 16. Based on the foregoing, Respondent has violated Section 458.331(1)(t)1, Florida Statutes (2007), by committing medical malpractice.

Based on the foregoing, Respondent violated Section 458.331(1)(m), Florida Statutes (2010-2011).  Facts specific to Patient DQ 38. On April 19, 2011, Patient DQ presented to Dr. KM at the  Casselberry Relief Center (Clinic) in Casselberry, Florida, with complaints of  13 we  back pain. Records indicate that Patient DQ disclosed a medication history consisting of an existing prescription for 120 tablets of hydrocodone 10 mg. Patient DQ presented with a MRI performed in 2008 that showed a small L5-S1 disc protrusion. | |  39. A urine drug screen was performed on this visit and was positive for morphine/opiates and oxycodone, even though the patient reported previous prescriptions for only hydrocodone. Despite this, Dr. KM, a doctor at the clinic, prescribed Patient DQ 90 tablets of oxycodone 30 mg, Lortab, twice a day, Naprosyn, and Ambien.  40. On May 17, 2011, Patient DQ presented to Dr. KM for a follow- up appointment. An examination was not performed and Patient DQ’s prescriptions were refilled.  41. On June 20, 2011, although no appointment was documented, Dr. KM prescribed 90 tablets of oxycodone 30 mg, Lortab, twice a day, Naprosyn, and Ambien to Patient DQ.  42. On July 8, 2011, Patient DQ presented to the Clinic and was seen by Respondent. Respondent noted that the patient had gone through 30 days of medication in 16 days.

Respondent eliminated the patient’s prescription for Lortab and added a prescription for Valium.  43. Respondent’s medical records contain no justification for increasing Respondent's oxycodone, the addition of Valium and the discontinuance of Naproxen for Patient DQ.  44.

Patient DQ’s initial treatment plan included physical therapy, massage and chiropractic treatment. However, after Respondent started treating the patient, Respondent did not follow-up to determine if the patient had obtained any of the above-listed alternative treatments and if so, the effect of the treatment. Respondent did not document that she discussed or offered any other treatment modalities other than prescribed controlled substances. In addition, there is no indication that Respondent considered the patient's discordant drug screens in relation to the continued prescription of controlled substances.  49. The prevailing professional standard for the use of controlled substances for the treatment of pain required Respondent to create a written treatment plan that stated objectives for determining the success of treatment, to consider alternative modalities of treatment.  50. The prevailing professional standard of care required Respondent to alter her prescribing practices or document her reason for not altering her prescribing practices, given the discrepancies between  Patient DQ’s drug screens and prescribed medication.  16 51. The prevailing professional standard of care required Respondent to refer the patient for further evaluation or consultation for the determination of the etiology of the patient’s pain.  52. The medical records created by Respondent for Patient DQ do not document a justification for the types and amounts of medications prescribed by Respondent. In addition, Respondent failed to document a treatment plan that identified treatment objectives and failed to document any significant abnormal examinations findings or functional changes in the patient that would justify the treatment.

On May 5, June 6 and July 5, 2011, Patient DT presented to Respondent for follow-up appointments. At each appointment, Respondent prescribed 180 tablets of oxycodone 30 mg, 30 tablets of Valium 10 mg and 30 tablets of Flexeril 10 mg.  19. On August 5, 2011, Patient DT presented to Respondent for a follow-up appointment. DT submitted to a multi-drug urine screen that was negative for oxycodone and benzodiazepine, notwithstanding the fact that Respondent had repeatedly prescribed oxycodone and benzodiazepine to the patient. Despite these results, Respondent continued the prescription of 180 tablets of oxycodone 30 mg and 30 tablets of Valium 10 mg.  20. Respondent’s medical records for Patient DT’s follow-up on  August 5, 2011, lack any documentation as to any consideration,  explanation or discussion of the patient’s drug screen results or any alteration of Respondent's prescribing practices.  21. On September 2, 2011, Patient DT presented to Respondent for follow-up. DT submitted to another multi-drug screen, which was positive for oxycodone and opiates but was negative for benzodiazepine. Again, despite a second unexplained drug screen result, Respondent prescribed 180 tablets of oxycodone 30 mg and 30 tablets of Valium 10 mg. The medical records contain no documentation justifying the continuation of prescriptions with unexplained drug screen results. —  22. On November i, 2011, Patient DT presented to Respondent for follow-up. DT submitted to a multi-drug urine screen and tested positive for cocaine, oxycodone and benzodiazepines. Again, despite a third unexplained drug screen result, Respondent continued Patient DT’s prescriptions and failed to document any explanation. Respondent documented the referral of Patient DT to an addictionologist.  23. On November 23, 2011, Patient DT presented to Respondent for a follow-up appointment. Respondent continued the previously prescribed 180 tablets of oxycodone 30 mg and 30 tablets of Valium 10  mg. The medical records contain no documentation regarding the consult with the “addictionologist” or previous discrepancies between drug screen results and prescriptions. ,  24. Patient DT’s medical records indicate that the initial treatment plan created by other physicians for the patient included physical therapy, massage and chiropractic treatment. However, once Respondent took over the care of this patient, the medical records do not document the success or failure of the alternative treatment modalities or whether or not the patient was actually pursuing the alternative treatment modalities.  25. The standards for the use of controlled substances for the treatment of pain required Respondent to create a written treatment plan that stated objectives for determining the success of treatment. :  26. The prevailing professional standard of care required Respondent to take affirmative action to address the discrepancies between Patient DT’s drug screen results and his prescribed medication and to document such action.  27. The prevailing professional standard of care required Respondent to follow-up on the previous referrals for the patient to pursue massage therapy and chiropractic treatment and to consult with an  addictionologist.

Petitioner was represented by Irving Levine, Assistant General Counsel. Respondent was not present but was represented by Sean Ellsworth, Esquire.  Upon review of the Recommended Order, the argument of the parties, and after a review of the complete record in this case, the Board makes the following findings and conclusions.  FINDINGS OF FACT 1. The findings of fact set forth in the Recommended Order  are approved and adopted and incorporated herein by reference. on February 15, 2008. The post-hearing proposals of both parties have been fully considered in rendering this Recommended Order.  All references to Florida Statutes in this Recommended ‘order are to the 2003 version unless otherwise noted. | | FINDINGS OF FACT  A. The Parties.  1. Petitioner, the Department of Health (hereinafter veteecea to as the ""Department""), is the agency of the State of Florida charged with the responsibility for the investigation and prosecution of complaints involving physicians licensed to practice medicine in Florida. § 20.43 and Chs. 456 and 458, Fla. Stat. (admitted facts).  2. Respondent, Jose eHaree~Diae, M.D., is, and was at the times material to this matter, a physician licensed to practice medicine in Florida, having been issued license number ME 14791. (Admitted facts).  3. Dr. Suarez-Diaz Le heapdteriieaed dn Anesthesiology. (Admitted facts).  4. Dr. Suarez-Diaz’s mailing address of record at all times relevant to this matter is 8340 S.W. 62nd Avenue, Miami,  Florida 33143. (Admitted Facts).  5. The Department conceded that Dr. Suarez-Diaz has not previously been the subject of a license disciplinary © proceeding.  B. Patient J.C.  6. On October 28, 2003, J.C. was admitted to Mercy Hospital in Miami, Florida, with a diagnosis of possible appendicitis.  7. J.C., a 49-year-old male, had a history of heart attack, which occurred in 1998, five years prior to his admission; pneumonia which occurred two months prior to his admission; and chronic obstructive ae diweaen.  8. After admission, J.C. underwent a chest x-ray, which showed moderate cardiomegaly, and an EXG, which showed left ventricular hypertrophy.  9. J.C. was scheduled for an immediate laparoscopic — with Dr. Suarez-Diaz in charge of anesthesiology.  10. Prior to surgery Dr. Suarez-Diaz seinen a pre- anesthesia evaluation, documenting J.C.’s history of a 1998 heart attack, pneumonia two months prior to admission, and chronic obstructive pulmonary Gisease. He did not, however, document the results of the chest x-ray.  11. At approximately 2330 hours {11:30 p.m.), Dr. Suarez- Diaz began anesthesia. J,C. was, from the start of surgery,  connected to the following monitors: pulse oximoetry (which  7206  Measured the level of oxygen in J.C.’s blood); electrocardiogram (which measures heart activity); and NCO2 monitor (which measured the level of CO2 in J.C.'s blood); and a blood pressure monitor (hereinafter these monitors are collectively referred to as the “Monitors”). Dr. Suarez-Diaz documented the connection of all of the Monitors, except the NCO2 monitor, in J.C.‘s medical records.  12. The Monitors, consistent with insurance requirements, remained connected to J.C. — a the surgery, and, based upon Dr. Suarez-Diaz’s uncontroverted and convincing testimony, were nanicemmed throughout J.C.‘’s surgery.  13. Surgery commenced at approximately 2345 hours (11:45 p.m.).  14. Almost immediately after anesthesia was first administered, J.C. experienced bronchospasm {the constriction of his airway). In response, Dr. Suarez-Diaz appropriately increased the volume of gas into J.C.’s lungs.  15. In addition to constriction of 7.¢.'s airways, the few oxygen level recordings made by Dr. Suarez-Diaz indicate that J.C.’s blood oxygen levels were below normal, especially considering the amount of oxygen J.C. was being suis Gen.  16. Due to the emergency nature of the surgery, surgery  commenced after J.C.'s bronchospasm was controlled. 7208  17. What took place during surgery, from the standpoint of Dr. Suarez-Diaz’s responsibilities, cannot be determined from Dr. Suarez-Diaz's medical record, which is essentially illegible and grossly incomplete:  a. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings should have been recorded often, but were neil. Of the 15 diastolic readings which should have been: recorded, only five readings were;  b. Vital signs were not recorded until after 0045 hours (12:25 a.m.);  | c. Pulse oximoetry readings ended at 0015 hours (12:15 a.m.);  d. BKG readings were not recorded after 2400 hoaxes (midnight); and  e. End-tidal CO2 readings ended at 0015 hours (12:15 a.m.).  , 18. Surgery ended on October 29, 2003, at between 0015 and 0030 hours (12:15 and 12:30 a.m.).  19. Due to impacts on J.C.‘s diaphragm during the surgery, ventilation — so difficult that it became necessary for Dr. Suarez-Diaz to “bag” J.c. in order to maintain better | control over oxygen levels in J.C.'s blood. When a patient is  “bagged” ventilated is provided manually with a gas bag.  Bagging allows a physician to control the rate of ventilation in a way which a ventilator machine cannot. ,  20. Because Dr. Suarez-Diaz was engaged in bagging J seg and at the same time closely monitoring J.C.’s a levels, ‘Dr. Suarez-Diaz was unable to record his observations in J.C.’s medical records. According to Dr. Suarez-Diaz’s uncontroverted and persuasive testimony, J.C. was one of the three most difficult patients he had dealt with in his 50 years of experience.  21. When surgery ended, J.C. was kept in the operating room with all monitors connected. Dr. Suarez-Diaz still failed to record vital signs and oxygen saturation levels.  22. At some time between 0035 and 0045 hours (12:35 to 12:45 a.m.}), J.C. was extubated — removal of tubes used to breath for the patient) and was breathing on his own. While Dr. Suarez-Diaz noted in his records that J.C. had been extubated, he did not record whether the —— remained connected between the time he was extubated and then moved toa stretcher. According to his own uncontroverted testimony, he  did not maintain the monitors when J.C. was transferred to the  stretcher because, in Dr. Suarez-Diaz’s opinion, J.C. was  breathing on his own.  23. Shortly after extubation, J.C. experienced respiratory  difficulty and became dusky and pulseless. At approximately  7210  0045 hours (12:45 a.m.), J.C. was reintubated and a code was called for cardiac —? CPR and defibrillation were performed. Dr. Guaren-iifas remained until approximately 0100 hours (1:00 a.m.), when J.C. 's blood pressure was reestablished.  24. Electoencephalograms were performed on J.C. on October 29 and 31, 2003. Both tests indicated reduced activity consistent with a lack of oxygen to the brain. .  25. On November 10, 2003, J.C. was extubated with “do-not- resuscitate” orders. J.C. -died on November 18, 2003.  E. The Standard of Care. |  26. The Department obtained opinions of two expert witnesses concerning Dr. Suayen-ihiad? treatment of J.C.:  Joan Christie, M.D., who testified by deposition (Petitioner’s Exhibit 1); and Les King, M.D., whose opinion letter to the Department was admitted without objection as Respondent,  Dr: Suarez-Diaz’s Exhibit B. Dr. King’s opinion letter —_ not given as much weight as it may have if he had testified, but his opinions do raise significant questions about Dr. Christie's opinions. ‘  27. Both of the Department’s experts relied upon essentially the same information to formulate their options. Both reached contrary opinions concerning whether Dr. Suarez-~ Diaz failed to aeaeriae medicine in: accordance with the level of  care, skill, and treatment recognized in general law related to  10 health care licensure in violation of Section 458.331(1) (t), Florida Statutes (hereinafter referred to as the ""Standard of Care""}, in his treatment of J.C.  28. Dr. King offered the following general, summary opinion:  This patient had coronary artery disease of advanced stages HTW and COPD. This is not always information available prior to emergent surgery. Management of the anesthetic, ACLS and post code care are seemingly appropriate for the events. The subject met the standard of care.  29. Dr. Christie, on the other hand, testified generally that Dr. Suarez-Diaz violated the Standard of Care by failing to adequately monitor J.C. “prior to” extubation. The difficulty with Dr. Christie’s testimony in this regard is that she relied completely on the medical records for J.C., without any consideration of Dr. Suarez-Diaz's uncontroverted and convincing testimony that he indeed did monitor J.C. prior to extubation.  30. Dr. Christie’s testimony does not, therefore, support  a finding or conclusion that Dr. Suarez-Diaz violated the  Standard of Care “[b)y failing to maintain adequate monitoring . . . after extubation despite intra-operative indications of oxygenation difficulty... .”  31. Dr. Christie also offered the following opinion, which  apparently was intended to apply to the question of whether  11  7211 Dr. Suarez-Diaz violated the Standard of Care “after”  extubation:  7212  I think that the lack of monitoring, particularly in the last - lack of monitoring of end-tidal Co2 and oxygenation in the last half an hour and at the time of extubation are not the standard of care. .  Petitioner’s Exhibit 1, Page 33, Lines 21 through 25.  32. There are several problems with Dr. Christie’s opinion. First, she again relied completely on the medical records, without any consideration of Dr. Suarez-Diaz’s uncontroverted and convincing testimony as to why he did disconnected the monitors prior to placing J.C. on the stretcher. Secondly, Dr. Christie’s opinion is not very precise as to what period of time she is talking about. She clearly rendered her opinion as to the care provided at the time of extubation, but the Amended Administrative Complaint charges a  lack of monitoring “after extubation.” Thirdly, Dr. King  reached contrary conclusions on this matter.  33. Dr. King precisely addressed the question of whether g3.C. should have been monitored upon transport to the stretcher:  3. It is difficult to determine exactly what transpired at the end of anesthesia and in the moving to the stretcher piror to transport to Recovery. Charting is exceptionally incomplete. As far as meeting the standard of care, it seems to have been appropriate patient management. Standard of care de facto  12 is for patients to be transported from the operating room to recovery without monitoring. Appropriate care seems to have been rendered.  . .  13. For stable patients following surgery and anesthetics, general transport to recovery is un-monitored other than direct observation. Generally, if the patient is stable, there is not an issue in moving the patient to the stretcher unmonitored. —  Respondent, Dr. Suarez-Diaz’s Exhibit B.  34. While Dr. King's opinions may not be adequate, given the manner in which they were entered into evidence, to find that Dr. Suarez-Diaz “met the Standard of Care,” his statements, coupled with the lack of precision in Dr. Christie's opinion and Dr. Suarez-Diaz’s testimony; are adequate to find that Dr. Christie’s opinion does not support a finding or conclusion that Dr. Suarez-Diaz violated the Standard of Care “[b]y failing to maintain adequate monitoring prior to . .. extubation despite intra-operative indications of oxygenation @ifficoulty . » « «*  35, Finally, Dr. Christie opined, in relevant part, as follows concerning the issue of whether Dr. Suarez-Diiaz violated  the Standard of Care by simply “failing to maintain adequate  medical records”:  13  7213 In my view the practitioner did not meet the standards with respect to documentation and ~ in the medical records. . .°. Petitioner’s Exhibit 1, Page 10, Lines 7 through 9. Dr. Christie goes on to describe in some detail the significant shortcomings in Dr. Suarez-Diaz’s medical records for J.C.  36. Dr. Christie's opinion as to whether inadequate medical records along constitutes a violation of the Standard of Care, again, is contrary to Dr. King's opinion, and, more importantly, the definition of the Standard of Care. Clearly,  ‘Dr. Suarez-Diaz kept medical records which were inadequate as to whether he monitored J.C. The evidence, however, proved that, despite the inadequate denne, he did monitor J.C. and provided the care he was required to provide. The Standard of Care requires a physician to use adequate “care, skill, and treatment” of in the physician’s care of a patient. As poor as Dr. Suarez-Diaz’s records for J.C. were, the mere inadequate records do not support a finding that he did not provide adequate “care, skill, and treatment”. to J.C.  37. The evidence failed to prove that Dr. Suarez-Diaz violated the Standard of Care as alleged in the Amended Administrative Complaint in his care of J.C.  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  A. , Jurisdiction.  38. The Division of Administrative Hearings has  14 2. There is competent substantial evidence to support the  findings of fact. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  1. The Board has jurisdiction of this matter pursuant to Section 120.57(1), Florida Statutes, and Chapter 458, Florida Statutes.  2. ‘The conclusions of law set forth in the Recommended Order are approved and adopted and incorporated herein by reference.  PENALTY Upon a complete review of the record in this case, the  Board determines that the penalty recommended by the Administrative Law Judge be ACCEPTED. WHEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED AND ADJUDGED:  1. Count I of the Administrative Complaint is hereby dismissed.  2. Respondent shall pay an administrative fine in the amount of $2,500.00 to the Board within 30 days from the date this Final Order is filed.  3. Respondent shall document the completion of ten (10) hours of continuing medical education (CME) in the area of medical recordkeeping within one (1) year from the date this Final Order is filed. Respondent is required to take the FMA  medical records course as part of the CME required by this  jurisdiction over the subject matter of this proceeding and of the parties thereto pursuant to Sections 120.569, 120.57(1), and 456.073(5), Florida Statutes (2007).  B. The Burden and Standard of Proof.  39. The Department seeks to impose penalties against  . Dr. Suarez-Diaz's license through the Amended Administrative  Complaint that include suspension or revocation of his license © and/or the imposition of an administrative: fine. Therefore, the - Department has the burden of proving the specific allegations of fact that support its charge that Dr. Suarez-Diaz violated  Sections 458.331(1)(m) and (t), Florida Statutes, by clear and  _ convincing evidence. Department of Banking and Finance,  Division of Securities and Investor Protection v. Osborne Stern and Co., 670 So. 2d 932 (Fla. 1996); Ferris v. Turlington, 510 So. 2d 292 (Fla. 1987); Pou v. Department _ of Insurance and  Treasurer, 707 So. 2d 941 (Fla. 3d DCA 1998); Nair v. Department  of Business and Professional Regulation, 654 So. 2d 205 (Fla. ist DCA 1995); and § 120.57(1) (3), Fla. Stat. (2007) (""Findings  of fact shall be based on a preponderance of the evidence, except in penal or licensure disciplinary proceedings or except  as otherwise provided by statute."").  40. What constitutes ""clear and corivincing"" evidence was  described by the court in Evans Packing Co. v. Department of  15  Agriculture and Consumer Services, 550 So. 2d 112, 116, n. 5 (Pla. 1st DCA 1989), as follows:  . . . [C]lear and convincing evidence requires that the evidence must be found to be credible; the facts to which the ‘ witnesses testify must be distinctly remembered; the evidence must be precise and explicit and the witnesses must be lacking in confusion as to the facts in issue. The evidence must be of such weight that it produces in the mind of the trier of fact the firm belief or conviction, without hesitancy, as to the truth of the allegations sought to be established. Slomowitz v. Walker, 429 Sc. 2a 797, 800 (Fla. 4th DCA 1983).  See also In re Graziano, 696 So. 2d 744 (Fla. 1997}; In re Davey, 645 So. 2d 398 (Fla. 1994); and Walker v. Florida  Department of Business and Professional Regulation, 705 So. 2d  652 (Fla. 5th DCA 1998) (Sharp, J., dissenting).  Cc. The Charges of the Administrative Complaint.  41. Section 458.331(1), Florida Statutes, authorizes the — of Medicine (hereinafter referred to as the ""Board""), to impose penalties ranging from the issuance of a letter of concern to revocation of a physician's a to practice medicine in Florida if a’ physician commits one or more acts specified therein.  42. The Amended Administrative Complaint alleges in  Count I that Dr. Suarez-Diaz violated Section 458.331(1)} (t),  Plorida Statutes, in his treatment of J.C. In Count II it is  16  alleged that Dr. Suarez-Diaz violated Section 458.331(1) (m), Florida Statutes, in his treatment of J.C...  D. Counts I: Violation of Section 458.331(1) (t), Florida  Statutes; The Standard of Care.  43. Section 458.331(1) (t), Florida Statutes, defines the following disciplinable offense:  Gross or repeated malpractice or the failure to practice medicine with that level of care, skill, and treatment which is recognized by a reasonably prudent similar physician as being acceptable under similar conditions and circumstances. The board shall give great weight to the provisions of S. 766.102 when enforcing this paragraph.  As used in this paragraph, ""repeated malpractice"" includes, but is not limited to, three or more claims for medical Malpractice within the previous 5-year period resulting in indemnities being paid in excess of $50,000 each to the claimant in a judgment or settlement and which incidents involved negligent conduct by the physician. As used in this paragraph, ""gross malpractice"" or ""the failure to practice medicine with that level of care, skill, and treatment which is recognized by a , reasonably prudent similar physician as being acceptable under similar conditions and circumstances,"" shall not be construed so as to require more than one instance, event, or act. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require that a physician be incompetent to practice medicine in order to be disciplined pursuant to this paragraph. A recommended order by an administrative law judge or a final order of the board finding a violation under this paragraph shall specify whether the licensee was found to have committed ""gross malpractice,"" ""repeated malpractice,” or ""failure to practice medicine with that  17  7218  level of care, skill, and treatment which is recognized as being acceptable under similar conditions and circumstances,"" or any combination thereof, and any publication by the board must so specify.  44. In paragraph 20 of the Amended Administrative Complaint, it is alleged that Dr. Suarez-Diaz violated the Standard of Care in his treatment of J.C. in one or more of the following ways:  (a) By failing to maintain adequate monitoring prior to and immediately after extubation despite intraoperative . indications of oxygen difficulty; (b) By failing to maintain adequate medical records in that much of his records for Patient J.C. are illegible, dosages of paralytic and reversal medication are not appropriately recorded, and oxygen saturations and vital signs are not recorded frequently enough.  The Department has essentially alleged that Dr. Suarez-Diaz violated the Standard of Care for three reasons:  a. The failure to monitor J.C. .prior to extubation;  b. The failure to monitor J.C, after extubation; and  c. The failure to keep adequate medical records.  The evidence failed to prove any of these charges.  45. When the expert opinion of Dr. Christie is weighed against the totality of the evidence in this case, including the uncontroverted and persuasive testimony of Dr. Suarez-Diaz and  the opinion of Dr. King, it cannot be said that the Department  proved clearly and convincingly that Dr. Suarez-Diaz violated the Standard of Care as alleged in the Amended Administrative Complaint.  46. As to whether Dr. Suarez-Diaz violated the Standard of Care simply because of his failure to keep adequate medical records, this sllegation is inadequate as a matter of law to support a Standard of Care violation. See Barr v. Department of Health, Board of Dentistry, 954 So. 2d 668 (Fla. 1st DCA 2007). In Barr the Dr. Barr, a dentist, was charged with failing to meet the standard of care for dentists for his actual treatment of a patient and by failing to maintain adequate records associated with the treatment. An Administrative Law Judge found that Dr. Barr had met or exceeded the standard as to his actual treatment, but, that his medical records were so inadequate, that his medical records were below the standard of care. The Board of Dentistry issued a final order accepting the ‘Administrative Law Judge’s findings. |  47. In reversing the Board of Dentistry, the court, while recognizing that the Board of Dentistry’s interpretation of a statute it was charged with administering was entitled to great weight, went on to reach the following conclusion about the Board of Dentistry’s interpretation of its standard of care statute:  The Board argues that particularly egregious |  recordkeeping violations could rise to the level of a “standard of care” violation.  19  7220  Because this interpretation renders subsection (m) [the equivalent of Section 458.331(m)] useless, it is clearly erroneous. We believe there is a significant difference between improperly diagnosing a patient, which constitutes a subsection (x) violation [the equivalent of Section 458.331(t)], and properly diagnosing a. patient, yet failing to properly document the actions taken on the patient’s chart, which constitutes a subsection (m) violation. ...  Barr at 669.  48. The rationale of the Barr decision applies equally to this case, to the extent that the Department has alleged that Dr. — violated the Standard of Care based solely on his inadequate record keeping. Neither the law, nor the facts, support this allegation.  49. The Department has failed Ye Blew and convincingly proved that Dr. Suarez-Diaz violated the Standard of Care —  alleged in Count I of the Amended Administrative Complaint.  E. Count II; Violation of Section 458.331(1) ({m), Florida Statutes; Medical Records.  50. Section 458.331(1) (m), Florida Statutes, defines the  following disciplinable offense:  Failing to keep legible, as defined by department rule in consultation with the board, medical records that identify the licensed physician or the physician extender and supervising physician by name and professional title who is or are responsible for rendering, ordering, supervising, or billing for each diagnostic or treatment  20  procedure and that justify the course of treatment of the patient, including, but not limited to, patient histories; examination results; test results; records of drugs prescribed, dispensed, or administered; and reports of consultations and hospitalizations. —  51. Florida Administrative Code Rule 64B8-9.003 (2) describes the type of welieal xesocia a physician must maintain in order to avoid discipline under Section 458.331(1) (m), Florida Statutes: )  . .  {2) A licensed physician shall maintain patient medical records in English, ina ‘ legible manner and with sufficient detail to. _ Clearly demonstrate why the course of treatment was undertaken.  (3) The medical record shall contain sufficient information to identify the patient, support the diagnosis, justify the treatment and document the course and results of treatment accurately, by including, at a minimum, patient histories; examination results; test results; records of drugs prescribed, dispensed, or administered; reports of consultations and hospitalizations; and copies of records or reports or other documentation obtained from other health care practitioners at the request of the physician and relied upon by the physician in determining the appropriate treatment of the patient.  (4) All entries made into the medical records shall be accurately dated and timed. Late entries are permitted, but must be clearly and accurately noted as last entries and dated and timed accurately when they are entered into the record. However, office records do not need to be timed, just dated.  21  7222  52. In paragraph 24, of the Amended Administrative Complaint, it is alleged that Dr. Suarez-Diaz failed to keep’ legible medical records justifying his course of treatment of J.C. in one or more of the following ways:  (a) by preparing illegible records; (b) by - failing to adequately document the dosages of medications prescribed to Patient J.C., including neuromuscular reversal agents; (c) by not recording the oxygen saturations, neuromuscular monitoring, and vital signs frequently enough.  53. Based upon Dr. Christie’s testimony, a review of  pertinent parts of Joint Exhibit 1, and Dr. Suarez-Diaz‘s  admission at the final hearing, Dr. Suarez-Diaz’s medical  records are largely illegible.  54. The same evidence proved that Dr. Suarez-Diaz failed to adequately document dosages of medications he prescribed for g.C., including neuromuscular reversal agents, which were identified on page 231 of Joint Exhibit 1, in his surgery records. |  55. Finally, the evidence proved clearly and convincingly, and Dr. Suarez-Diaz admitted at hearing, that he failed to record oxygen saturations, neuromuscular monitoring results, and J.C.'s vital signs frequently enough.  56. The evidence proved clearly and convincingly that  Dr. Suarez-Diaz failed to keep legible medical records  22 7223  ' justifying his course of treatment of J.C. by preparing  illegible records; (b) by failing to adequately document the dosages of medications prescribed to Patient J.C., imcluding neuromuscular reversal agents; and (c) by not recording the oxygen saturations, neuromuscular monitoring, and vital signs frequently enough in violation of Section 458.331(1) (m), Florida Statutes. .  F. The Appropriate Penalty.  57. In determining the appropriate punitive action to recommend to the Board in this'case, it is necessary to consult the Board's ""disciplinary guidelines,"" which impose restrictions and limitations on the exercise of the Board's disciplinary authority under Section 458.331, Florida Statutes. See Parrot Heads, Inc. v. Department of Business and Professional Regulation, 741 So. 2d 1231 (Fla. 5th DCA 1999).  58. The Board's guidelines are set out in Wortda Administrative Code Rule 64B8-8.001, which provides the following ""purpose"" and instruction on the application of the penalty ranges provided in the Rule:  (1) Purpose. Pursuant to Section 456.079, F.S., the Board provides within this rule disciplinary guidelines which shall be imposed upon applicants or licensees whom it regulates under Chapter 458, F.S. The purpose of this rule is to notify applicants and licensees of the  ranges of penalties which will routinely be imposed unless the Board finds it necessary  23  to deviate from the guidelines for the stated reasons given within this rule. The ranges of penalties provided below are based upon a single count violation of each provision listed; multiple counts of the violated provisions or a combination of the violations may result in a higher penalty than that for a single, isolated violation. Each range includes the lowest and highest penalty and all penalties falling between. The purposes of the imposition of discipline are to punish the applicants or licensees for violations and to deter them from future violations; to offer opportunities for _ rehabilitation, when appropriate; and to deter other applicants or licensees from violations. ,  (2) Violations and Range of Penalties. In imposing discipline upon applicants and licensees, in proceedings pursuant to Section 120.57(1) and 120.57(2), F.S., the Board shall act in accordance with the following disciplinary guidelines and shall impose'a penalty within the range , corresponding to the violations set forth below. The verbal identification of offenses are descriptive only; the full language of each statutory provision cited must be consulted in order to determine the conduct included.  59. Florida Administrative Code Rule 64B8-8.001(2) (m) provides, in pertinent part, for a penalty for a violation of Section 458.331(1)(m), Florida Statutes, of a reprimand to denial of licensure or two years' suspension, followed by  probation, and an administrative fine of from $1,000.00 to  $10,000.00.  60. Florida Administrative Code Rule 64B8-8.001(2) (t)3.  provides, in pertinent part, for a penalty for a violation of  paragraph. In addition, Respondent shall be required to take additional CME in recordkeeping for a total of 10 hours. These hours shall be in addition to those hours required for biennial renewal of licensure. Respondent shall first submit a written request to the Probation Committee for approval prior to performance of said CME course(s). Unless otherwise approved by the Board or the Chairperson of the Probation Committee, said continuing education courses shall consist of a formal live lecture format.  4. Respondent shall be and hereby is REPRIMANDED by the Board.  RULING ON MOTION TO ASSESS COSTS  The Board reviewed the Petitioner’s Motion to Assess Costs associated with this case in the amount of $20,448.06. Respondent disputed the factual assertions in the Petitioner’s Motion to Assess Costs and requested an administrative hearing with regard to the matter of costs. The Board permitted the Respondent 10 days to amend his request for an administrative hearing to set forth the facts in dispute with regard to the costs in this matter. Respondent shall amend his request within  10 days from the date of entry of this Final Order.  NOTE: SEE RULE 64B8-8.0011, FLORIDA ADMINISTRATIVE CODE. UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED BY FINAL ORDER, THE RULE SETS FORTH THE REQUIREMENTS FOR PERFORMANCE OF ALL PENALTIES CONTAINED IN THIS FINAL ORDER. )  Section 458.331(1)} (t), Florida Statutes, sf — two years’ probation to revocation, and an administrative fine of $1,000.00 to $10,000.00. |  61. Florida Administrative Code Rule 64B8-8.001 (3) provides that, in applying the penalty guidelines, the following aggravating and mitigating circumstances are to be taken into account:  (3) . Aggravating and Mitigating Circumstances. Based upon consideration of aggravating and mitigating factors present in an individual case, the Board may deviate from the penalties recommended above. The Board shall consider as aqgravating or mitigating factors the following:  (a) Exposure of patient or public to injury or potential injury, physical or otherwise: none, slight, severe, or death;  (b) Legal status at the time of the offense: no restraints, or legal constraints;  (c) The number of counts or separate offenses established;  (d) The number of times the same offense or offenses have previously been committed by the licensee or applicant;  (e) The disciplinary history of the applicant or licensee in any jurisdiction and the length of practice;  '(£) Pecuniary benefit or self-gain inuring to the applicant or licensee;  (g) The involvement in any violation of Section 458.331, Florida Statutes, of the provision of controlled substances for trade, barter or sale, by a licensee. In such cases, the Board will deviate from the penalties recommended above and impose suspension or revocation of licensure;  (h) Any other relevant mitigating factors.  25  7225  7226  62. In Petitioner's Proposed Recommended Order, the Department has suggested that the fenieuiny abe mitigating and aggravating circumstances in this case: “Respondent is under no legal constraints; the patient died; this is a two count complaint; Respondent had not previously been disciplined; there are no other incidents.” The Department has requested that it be recommended that Dr. Suarez-Diaz receive a reprimand; be required to pay an administrative fine of $10,000.00; attend no less than ten hours of continuing medical education to be specified by the Board; ae peerern 100 hours of community service. These suggested penalties are excessive in that the Department failed to prove the allegations of Count I of the Amended Administrative Complaint and because the Board's statutory authority and adopted rules do not provide for community service. |  63. In Respondent, Jose Suarez-Diaz, M.D.’s Proposed Recommended Order, Dr. Suarez-Diaz has suggested that the Board issue a Letter of Guidance and require that he pay an administrative fine of $1,000.00. The Letter of Guidance is less than the guideline of the Board’s rules of.a reprimand to denial of licensure or two years' suspension, followed by probation, and an administrative fine of from $1,000.00 to  $10,000.00.  26 RECOMMENDATION  Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of ‘Law, it is .  RECOMMENDED that the a final order be entered by the Board of Medicine dismissing Count I of the Amended Administrative , Complaint; finding that Jose Suarez-Diaz, M.D., has violated Section 458.331(1)(m), Florida Statutes, as alleged in Count II of the Amended Administrative Complaint; issuing a reprimand; requiring chet he pay an administrative fine of $2,500; and requiring that he attend ten hours of continuing medical education related to appropriate record —_—  DONE AND ENTERED this 13th day of March, 2008, in  Tallahassee, Leon County, Florida.  .

As grounds therefore, Petitioner states the following: - |  1. At its next regularly scheduled meeting, the Board of Medicine will take up for consideration the above-styled disciplinary action and will enter a  Final Order therein.  2. Section 456.072(4), Florida Statutes (2003), states as follows:  _In addition to any other discipline imposed through final order, or citation, entered on or after July 1, 2001, pursuant to this section or discipline imposed through final order, or citation, entered on or after July 1, 2001, for a violation of any practice act, the board, or the department when there is no board, shall assess costs related to the investigation and prosecution of the case. Such costs related to the investigation and prosecution include, but are not limited to, salaries and benefits of personnel, costs related to the time spent by the attorney and other personnel working on the case, and any other expenses incurred by the department for the case.

Jose Suarez-Diaz, M.D.) are summarized in Exhibit 1 (Cost Summary Report), which is attached to this document.  7) The itemized costs and expenses for DOH case number 2003-28432 (Department of Health v. Jose Suarez-Diaz, M.D.) are detailed in Exhibit 2 (Itemized Cost Report and Itemized Expense Report and . receipts), which is attached to this document.  7287 8) The itemized costs as reflected in Exhibit 2 are determined by the fotlowing method: DOH employees who work on cases daily are to keep track of their time in six-minute increments (e.g., investigators and lawyers). A designated DOH employee in the Consumer Services Unit, Legal Department, and in each area office, inputs the time worked and expenses spent into the Time Tracking System. Time and expenses are charged against a state health care Board (e.g., Florida Board of Medicine, Florida Board of Dentistry, Florida Board of Osteopathic Medicine), and/or a case. !f no Board or case can be charged, then the time and expenses are charged as administrative time. The hourly rate of each employee is calculated by formulas established by the Department. (See the Itemized Cost Report)  9) James R. Cooksey, first being duly sworn, states that he has read the foregoing Affidavit and its attachments and the statements contained therein are true and correct to the best of his knowledge and belief.

VINAS, M.D.,  RESPONDENT. /  ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLAINT  Petitioner Department of Health files this Administrative Complaint before the Board of Medicine against Respondent Luis A. Vinas, M.D., and in support thereof alleges:  1. Petitioner is the state agency charged with regulating the practice of medicine pursuant to section 20.43, Florida Statutes; chapter 456, Florida Statutes; and chapter 458, Florida Statutes.  2. At all times material to this Administrative Complaint, Respondent was a licensed physician within the state of Florida, having been issued license number ME 57391.  3. Respondent’s address of record is 550 South Quadrille  Boulevard, West Palm Beach, Florida 33401.  1  | EXHIBIT | A 4, Respondent is Board-Certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery.  5, At all times material to this Administrative Complaint, Respondent practiced as a plastic surgeon at the Surgical Arts Pavilion?, located in Wellington, Florida.  6. Onor about May 25, 2016, Respondent performed a liposuction procedure at Surgical Arts Pavilion on patient A.R.’s lateral chest, abdomen, and flanks.  7. Patient A.R. experienced no intraoperative complications during the liposuction procedure and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.  8. Respondent observed patient A.R’s condition for a period of time and after determining she was stable, Respondent discharged patient A.R.  9. Approximately one hour after leaving the Surgical Arts Pavilion, patient A.R. was taken to the emergency department at JFK Medical Center after fainting at home.  10. Patient A.R.’s daughter, D.G., informed Respondent of patient  A.R.’s condition.  1 The Surgical Arts Pavilion in Wellington, Florida, ceased operations.  2 11. After observing patient A.R. wore a compression garment on her abdomen, reviewing patient A.R.’s medical notes, and speaking with patient A.R. about her recent liposuction procedure, Dr. E.F., an emergency room physician at JFK Medical Center, admitted patient A.R. to the hospital.  12. On or about May 26, 2016, patient A.R.’s hemoglobin drastically dropped from 11.3 g/dL to 8.6 g/dL; on May 27, 2016, patient A.R.’s hemoglobin dropped from 8.6 g/dL to 6.2 g/dL; and on or about May 28, 2016, patient A.R.’s hemoglobin rose to 8.0 g/dL after she received two units of red blood cells.  13. On or about May 27, 2016, patient A.R. removed the abdominal binder.  14. Dr. E.M., a physician at JFK Medical Center, unsuccessfully attempted to contact Respondent regarding the nature of the liposuction procedure he performed on patient A.R.  15. On or about May 28, 2016, patient A.R. complained of heat, nausea, pain, and weakness.  16. Patient A.R.’s hemoglobin dropped to 4.3 g/dL on or about May  29, 2016, after she began to show signs of hypovolemic shock. 17. On or about May 29, 2016, Respondent visited the JFK Medical Center to speak with Dr. G.M. regarding patient A.R.’s care.  18. Respondent noted patient A.R. lost a significant amount of blood which should have been replenished with appropriate transfusions.  19. After conversing with Respondent, Dr. G.M., a general and vascular surgeon, decided to perform a surgical exploration of patient A.R.’s abdomen to determine the source of the blood loss.  20, Even though Respondent had hospital privileges at the JFK Medical Center, he did not assist Dr. G.M. in the exploratory surgery.  20. During the explorative surgery, Dr. G.M. was unable to find the source of patient A.R.’s blood loss.  21. Dr. G.M. determined that blood deposits had infiltrated through the subcutaneous fat and decided to insert two drains to help evacuate any excess fluid and blood.  22, Dr. G.M. decided to apply another abdominal binder to help slow and/or stop blood flow.  23. After Respondent arrived at the JFK Medical Center on or about May 30, 2016, he noted patient A.R. was in the intensive care unit and had  stable labs after receiving a transfusion. 24. Shortly after Respondent left the hospital, patient A.R.’s oxygen saturation level dropped. 25. Staff detected copious amounts of drainage in the endotracheal tube and removed the endotracheal tube. 26. Hospital staff were unable to re-intubate the patient successfully and masked ventilation proved unsuccessful. 28. Onor about May 30, 2016, patient A.R. was declared dead after experiencing complications of anemia due to blood loss following liposuction. 29.

Levine, M.D., and in. support thereof alleges: |  1. , An Administrative Complaint was filed in this matter on May 16, 2011.  . 2. The nineteenth Paragraph of the Administrative Complaint, located on page 5, incorrectly states that there is no documentation that the Respondent and the anesthesiologist discussed RSLs condition as it related to anesthesia risks prior to surgery, either in the days prior to June  6, 2007, or r the morning of June 6, 2007. This is a scrivener’s error as the  1 COUNT ONE  25. Petitioner realleges and incorporates paragraphs one (1) through twenty-four (24) as if fully set forth in this count.  26. Section 458.331(1)(t)1., Florida Statutes (2006), provides that committing medical malpractice constitutes grounds for disciplinary action by the Board of Medicine. Medical malpractice is defined in Section 456.50, Florida Statutes (2006), as the failure to Practice medicine in accordance with the level of care, skill, and treatment recognized in general law related to health care licensure.  27. For purposes of Section 458.331(1)(t)1., Florida Statutes (2006), the Board shall give great weight to the provisions of Section 766.102, Florida Statutes (2006), which provides that the prevailing professional standard of care for a given health care provider shall be that level of care, skill, and treatment which, in light of all relevant surrounding circumstances, is recognized as acceptable and appropriate by reasonably prudent similar health care providers.  28. Respondent fell below the standard of care in one or more of  the following ways: a. By scheduling serious, major elective surgery for RSL, who had myotubular myopathy, diffuse muscular weakness of all his muscles, breathing difficulties, and very poor lung Capacity, without obtaining a complete consultation with a pulmonologist, a neurologist, and an anesthesiologist before scheduling the surgery;  b. By waiting until the morning of surgery to inform the anesthesiologists that RSL had myotubular myopathy, diffuse muscular weakness of all his muscles, breathing difficulties, and very poor lung capacity;  c. By waiting until the morning of surgery to consult with the anesthesiologists regarding general anesthesia for RSL who had myotubular myopathy, diffuse muscular weakness of all his muscles, occasional shortness of breath and very poor lung Capacity;  d. By establishing a plan for an elective laparotomy with appendectomy and possible sigmoid colectomy which was  inappropriate based on the risks involved; e. By failing to thoroughly consult with the anesthesiologists after the anesthesia evaluation at 7:00 a.m. on June 6, 2007, before the induction of pre-operative medication, to allow RSL to change his mind or Respondent to change his mind if appropriate.  29. Based on the foregoing, Respondent has violated Section 458.331(1)(t)1., Florida Statutes (2006), by committing medical malpractice.  COUNT TWO  30. Petitioner realleges and incorporates paragraphs one (1) through twenty-four (24) as if fully set forth in this count.  31. Section 458.331(1)(m), Florida Statutes (2006), subjects a doctor to discipline for failing to keep legible, as defined by department rule in consultation with the board, medical records that identify the licensed physician or the physician extender and supervising physician by name and professional title who is or are responsible for rendering, ordering, supervising, or billing for each diagnostic or treatment procedure and that justify the course of treatment of the patient, including, but not limited to, patient histories; examination results; test results; records of  10 drugs prescribed, dispensed, or administered; and reports of consultations and hospitalizations.  32. Respondent failed to keep legible medical records that justify the course of treatment of the patient by failing to document the specific risks of serious, major elective surgery discussed with RSL prior to the informed consent and by failing to document any details of the risks he with RSL on June 2, 2006, discussed in light of RSL’s myotubular myopathy, diffuse muscular weakness of all his muscles, occasional shortness of breath and very poor lung capacity.  33. Based on the foregoing, Respondent has violated Section 458.331(1)(m), Florida Statutes (2006), by to keep legible medical records that justify the course of treatment of the patient, including, but not limited to, patient histories; examination results; test results; records of drugs prescribed, dispensed, or administered; and reports of consultations and hospitalizations.

Kiesling Assistant General STATE OF FLORIDA  DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, PETITIONER, v. CASE NO. 2008-09726 STEVEN M. LEVINE, M.D., RESPONDENT.  ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLAINT  Petitioner, Department of Health, by and through undersigned counsel, files this Administrative Complaint before the Board of Medicine against Respondent, Steven M. Levine, M.D., and in support thereof alleges:  1. Petitioner is the state department charged with regulating the practice of medicine pursuant to Section 20.43, Florida Statutes; Chapter 456, Florida Statutes; and Chapter 458, Florida Statutes.  2. At all times material to this Complaint, Respondent was a licensed medical doctor within the state of Florida, having been issued license number ME 44283.  3. Respondent's address of record is 4957 38"" Avenue North,  Suite C, St. Petersburg, Florida 33710-2174.  » 4. Respondent is board certified by the American Board of Surgery.  5. Patient R.S.L. (RSL), a then 33 year-old male, was admitted to St. Petersburg General Hospital (Hospital) in January, 2005, with abdominal pain. A CT scan showed inflammatory changes in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen with a 3 cm. abscess superior to the bladder.  6. The patient was treated with antibiotics and the abscess and inflammation subsided.  7. At the end of 2005, RSL again complained of left lower quadrant abdominal discomfort. He was scheduled for an elective laparotomy with appendectomy and possible sigmoid colectomy in December, 2005. The surgery was cancelled because RSL had bronchitis.  8. A sigmoid colectomy is resection of the sigmoid colon, sometimes including part or all of the rectum.  9. The surgery was rescheduled for June 6, 2006. Between December, 2005, and June, 2006, RSL continued to complain, periodically, of occasional left lower quadrant discomfort.  10. Respondent was aware that RSL suffered from myotubular  myopathy and had diffuse muscular weakness of all his muscles. He was  2 also aware that RSL suffered from occasional shortness of breath and very poor lung capacity.  11. Myotubular myopathy is a disease of the muscle tissue itself, most notably muscle weakness and associated disabilities and pulmonary complications (presumably due to weakness of the muscles responsible for respiration). For the myotubularin-related form, symptoms include profound loss of muscle tone, weakness of skeletal muscles, respiratory insufficiency, eye muscle weakness, drooping eyelids; however, weakness mainly in muscles closer to the center of the body (proximal muscles) may be exhibited.  12. On June 2, 2006, Respondent documented that he discussed the risks of the surgery in light of RSL’s physical condition, and noted that RSL well understood the risks; however he did not document any details of the risks he discussed in light of RSL’s myotubular myopathy, diffuse muscular weakness of all his muscles, occasional shortness of breath and very poor lung capacity.  13. Additionally, Respondent did not refer RSL to an anesthesiologist for consultation or discussion of the risks of general anesthesia in light of RSL’s myotubular myopathy, diffuse muscular  3 weakness of all his muscles, occasional shortness of breath and very poor lung capacity. This consultation should have occurred prior to the morning of the surgery so that RSL was fully informed and was able to give a meaningful informed consent.  14. Respondent failed to refer RSL to a pulmonologist or a neurologist for consultation prior to the surgery. The pulmonologist would have performed pulmonology tests and arterial blood gases (ABGs) to better evaluate the risk of surgery and to make recommendations for pre- operative care, intra-operative considerations including choice of anesthesia and anesthesia agents, and post-operative management.  15. Based on RSL's myotubular myopathy, diffuse muscular weakness of all his muscles, occasional shortness of breath and very poor lung capacity, and the lack of the necessary consults, Respondent's plan for an elective laparotomy with appendectomy and possible sigmoid colectomy was inappropriate. The surgery should not have been done unless RSL suffered another bout of diverticulitis that did not resolve with antibiotics. The risks of the serious major elective surgery were too high.  16. On June 6, 2006, at approximately 5:45 a.m., RSL signed the informed consent form for the surgery. The nurse's notes, as part of that  4 process, show that RSL was very anxious and fearful of death; however, he was able to calm down sufficiently to sign the consent.  17. At 7:00 a.m. that morning, he was seen in consultation by Dr. B.S. regarding the anesthesia. The doctor’s notes show knowledge of RSLs medical condition, but do not document a thorough discussion with RSL about the risks of anesthesia.  18. At 7:02 a.m. the pre-operative medication was administered. Two minutes was not sufficient time for RSL to contemplate and digest the discussion about risks with the anesthesiologist prior to the induction of the pre-operative medication.  19. There is no documentation that the Respondent and the anesthesiologist discussed RSL's condition as it related to anesthesia risks Prior to surgery, either in the days prior to June 6, 2007, or the morning of June 6, 2007, or that specific risks of that nature were discussed with the patient.  20. The actual anesthesia was administered by Dr. FD. Both Dr. B.S. and Dr. FD. had minimal knowledge of the patient's condition of myotubular myopothy and the specific anesthesiology considerations for  that disease. 21. It is below the standard of care for a surgeon to schedule serious, major elective surgery in a patient with myotubular myopathy, diffuse muscular weakness of all his muscles, breathing difficulties, and very poor lung capacity, without obtaining a complete consultation with a pulmonologist, a neurologist, and an anesthesiologist before scheduling the surgery.  22. It is below the standard of care for a surgeon to wait until the morning of surgery to inform the anesthesiologists that a patient had myotubular myopathy, diffuse muscular weakness of all his muscles, breathing difficulties, and very poor lung capacity.  23. It is below the standard of care for a surgeon to wait until the morning of surgery to consult with the anesthesiologists regarding general anesthesia for a patient who has myotubular myopathy, diffuse muscular weakness of all his muscles, occasional shortness of breath and very poor lung capacity.  24. It is below the standard of care for a surgeon to refer to his explanation of the risks of serious, major elective surgery On a patient with myotubular myopathy, diffuse muscular weakness of all his muscles,  occasional shortness of breath and very poor lung capacity as the basis for  6 the informed consent without thoroughly documenting what risks were  discussed.",2011,FL

At all times material to this Administrative Complaint, Respondent was a licensed physician within the state of Florida, having been issued license number ME 73376.  3. Respondent's address of record is 1461 Marseille Drive, Miami  Beach, Florida 33141.  4. At all times material to this Administrative Complaint, Respondent practiced as an Obstetrician and Gynecologist at Memorial Regional Hospital (MRH), located in Hollywood, Florida.  5. Respondent is board-certified in Obstetrics and Gynecology by the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology.  6. On or about December 29, 2014, J.W., a pregnant twenty-two (22) year-old female, sought treatment at MRH for abdominal and back pain at thirty-three (33) weeks gestation.  7. J.W. had a history of a previous cesarean section and was recently diagnosed with placenta previa/increta.1 J.W. was also subsequently diagnosed with placenta percreta and/or placenta accreta.?  8. On or about December 29, 2014, J.W. was admitted to MRH for further observation and care.  9. On or about January 6, 2015, J.W. was scheduled to undergo a planned cesarean-section delivery with a total abdominal hysterectomy.  10. Respondent was the surgeon assigned to perform the  procedures.  1 Placenta previa occurs when a baby’s placenta partially or totally covers the mother’s cervix. Placenta increta occurs when a baby’s placenta attaches deeply into the uterine wall and remains firmly attached.  ? Placenta percreta occurs when a baby’s placenta grows through the uterine wall. Placenta accreta occurs when a baby’s placenta grows too deeply into the uterine wall.  2 11. On or about January 6, 2015, J.W. underwent a cesarean section and a live baby girl was delivered.  12. After the delivery, the baby’s placenta was found to be firmly attached to the uterine wall.  13. Subsequently, Respondent pulled the baby’s umbilical cord which was attached to the portion of the placenta firmly attached to the uterine wall causing it to separate from the uterine wall.  14. Shortly thereafter, J.W. experienced profuse blood loss and underwent an exploratory laparotomy in attempts to control the bleeding.  15. J.W. then received extensive cardiopulmonary resuscitation, but ultimately expired.  16. At all times relevant to this case, the prevailing professional standard of care required that, when dealing with patients such as J.W., a physician not pull on the umbilical cord after delivery of a baby.  17. Section 458.331(1)(t)1., Florida Statutes (2014), subjects a licensee to discipline for committing medical malpractice as defined in Section 456.50(1)(g), Florida Statutes. Section 456.50(1)(g), Florida Statutes (2014), states that medical malpractice means the failure to practice  medicine in accordance with the level of care, skill, and treatment recognized  in general law related to health care licensure. Section 766.102, Florida Statutes (2014), provides that the prevailing standard of care for a given healthcare provider shall be that level of care, skill, and treatment which, in light of all relevant surrounding circumstances, is recognized as acceptable and appropriate by reasonably prudent similar health care providers.  18. At times relevant to this case, Respondent failed to meet the prevailing professional standard of care in his treatment of J.W. by pulling on the umbilical cord after delivery of the baby which in turn separated a large piece of the placenta which then resulted in profuse hemorrhage which was unable to be controlled. |  19. Based on the foregoing, Respondent violated section 458.331(1)(t)1., Florida Statutes (2014), by committing medical malpractice as defined in section 456.50(1)(g), Florida Statutes.  {Signature appears on the following page}  WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that the Board of  Medicine enter an order imposing one or more of the following penalties:  permanent revocation or suspension of Respondent's license, restriction of  practice, imposition of an administrative fine, issuance of a reprimand,  placement of the Respondent on probation, corrective action, refund of fees  billed or collected, remedial education and/or any other relief that the Board  deems appropriate.

The medical record should document the nature and intensity of the pain, current and past treatments for pain, underlying or coexisting diseases or conditions, the effect of the pain on physical and psychological function, and history of substance abuse. The medical record also should document the presence of one or more recognized medical indications for the use of a controlled substance.  (b) Treatment Plan. The written treatment plan should state objectives that will be used to determine treatment  Astrid Alejandra Febre, M.D. Case No. 2009-24467 success, such as pain relief and improved physical and psychosocial function, and should indicate if any further diagnostic evaluations or other treatments are planned. After treatment begins, the physician should adjust drug therapy to the Patient medical needs of each patient.

Elmhurst performed psychological testing on the Respondent, which revealed significant interpersonal problems. Elmhurst diagnosed the Respondent as having bipolar disorder type II and non-specified personality disorder with borderline features.  19. Elmhurst found that the Respondent was not fit to return to the practice of medicine and recommended that she undergo weekly psychotherapy, with quarterly reports submitted to the New York Committee for Physician Health for monitoring.  20. In 2008, the Respondent returned to Florida and started substitute teaching in public schools in Duval County. She has been on permanent disability since 2009 due to her life-long mental health diagnosis and her inability to handle the responsibilities of being an active practicing clinician. She limits her earned income from teaching so as not to jeopardize her disability income.  21. In 2009, the Respondent voluntarily participated in another intensive outpatient treatment program at the Talbot Recovery Center in Atlanta, Georgia. The Respondent went to Talbot to learn coping and management skills related to her  bipolar disorder. 43161  DOB goTravel System REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION TO INCUR TRAVEL EXPENSES  Created By: RICHARDSON, RICKEY Created Date: 9/21/2017 12:25:28 PM Mr. Bell will be a passenger in the rental car driven by Mr. Chad Dunn.

In April of 2012, the Respondent again pursued re-entry into the practice of medicine by undergoing a Comprehensive Assessment and Remedial Education Services Program provided by the University of Florida, commonly called Florida CARES.  23. At Florida CARES, Dr. Duane Dede performed a neuropsychological evaluation of the Respondent. Dr. Dede’s diagnostic impression was that the Respondent had bipolar disorder ‘type I. He expressed reservations about her complex problem-solving ability and processing speed. He acknowledged that high-stress situations could exacerbate those problems.  24. Because of these reservations, Dr. Dede concluded that the Respondent would be able to gradually return to the practice of medicine, with monitoring, if she performed well on the other portions of the Florida CARES evaluation. She did not.  25. Florida CARES assessed the Respondent’s knowledge and abilities related to practicing obstetrics and gynecology, which had been her area of practice in 2004. The practice portion of the evaluation revealed “widespread significant deficits” related to the Respondent’s knowledge base and ability to apply knowledge appropriately. Florida CARES believed that the Respondent needed Significant retraining. Florida CARES also recommended that the Respondent be required to maintain an active contract with PRN if  she entered retraining or returned to the practice of medicine.

The Respondent testified that she had telephonic communication with PRN staff, including its medical director, in May 2013 and explained her difficulty finding a local psychiatrist. It was suggested that she contact an indigent care provider called Manatee Glens that probably would accept her as a patient. The Respondent followed up on the suggestion and became a patient at Manatee Glens. Eventually, she found and was accepted as a patient by a local psychiatrist named Dr. Tarig Halim.  33. The Respondent admitted that she violated her PRN contract by failing to submit quarterly mental health updates. She attempted to blame her non-compliance on the difficulties of moving, finding a job, and finding a psychiatrist. Those things do not constitute good cause for non-compliance.  34. At some point in June or July 2013, the Respondent changed telephone service providers and was issued a new phone number with a Bradenton area code. She did not report this to  PRN.  11 40923  35. On July 26, 2013, Lina Carzoli, a PRN case manager, attempted to contact the Respondent using the telephone number on file, but she was unable to do so. Three days later, Debra Troupe, a PRN chief compliance officer who had been the Respondent’s long-term case manager at PRN for a long time, attempted to contact the Respondent at that number but could not because the telephone number had been disconnected.  36. Between 2008 and 2013, the Respondent had repeated instances of material non-compliance with her PRN contract, including failure to provide current contact information, failure to timely return calls, and failure to provide required mental health updates. On those occasions, PRN allowed the Respondent to remain in the program. PRN sent three warning letters during those years, but it did not terminate her contract or refer her to DOH for disciplinary action on those occasions. On August 1, 2013, PRN terminated the Respondent’s contract and referred her file to the DOH because it had been unable to contact her and was unable to monitor her.  37. The Respondent complains that PRN could have used other means to attempt to contact her, including electronic mail and regular mail (to her parents’ address). That may be true, and it is possible that the ensuing consequences could have been avoided if PRN had done so, but it is undeniable that the Respondent did  not comply with her obligations under her PRN contract.  12  40924  38. The Respondent violated the Board’s final orders by failing to comply with all terms of her PRN contract and being terminated for non-compliance without good cause.  39. In or about November of 2014, PRN readmitted the Respondent to the PRN program. As part of PRN’s intake process, the Respondent was required to submit to a current evaluation. This is normal for participants who have been out of the program for an extended period of time. It was not clear from the evidence whether there is a particular period of time out of the program that triggers the need for a current evaluation. It is debatable whether the Respondent had been out of the program for an extended period of time. However, it is clear that the Respondent most current evaluation at the time was by Florida CARES in mid-2012.  40. The Respondent complains that there are no clear criteria as to when a current evaluation is required for re-entry into the program and that all the consequences that flowed from PRN’s requirement of a current evaluation could have been avoided if PRN had allowed her to re-sign her previous PRN contract without another evaluation. In retrospect, she regrets that she agreed to meet PRN’s demands.  41. On or about February 10, 2015, Dr. Mark Sylvester, a psychiatrist, evaluated the Respondent. Dr. Sylvester diagnosed  Respondent with bipolar disorder type I and borderline  13  40925  personality disorder. He opined that the Respondent was not able to practice medicine with reasonable skill and safety. He was concerned that she admitted to drinking alcoholic beverages, if only socially on rare occasions, because she had a prescription for a benzodiazepine for breakthrough anxiety. He recommended that she enter into a PRN monitoring contract that included monitoring for substance abuse.  42. On or about March 24, 2015, PRN notified the Respondent of the results of her evaluation and Dr. Sylvester’s recommendations. PRN mailed a monitoring contract to the Respondent on March 24, 2015, and gave her ten days to return the executed contract. PRN subsequently extended the deadline for returning the executed contract to May 6, 2015, but the Respondent did not execute the contract. Instead, she requested a second opinion.  43. On or about January 27, 2016, Dr. Lawrence Wilson evaluated the Respondent to give her a second opinion.  Dr. Wilson is trained in addiction medicine. He is not a psychiatrist.  44, Dr. Wilson diagnosed the Respondent with bipolar disorder type I, having hypomanic components, and with a mild, generalized anxiety disorder. Dr. Wilson could not rule out the possibility that the Respondent also had borderline personality  traits.  14  40926  45. Dr. Wilson opined that the Respondent was not safe to return to the unsupervised clinical practice of medicine, but that she could re-engage in a full non-surgical residency training program. He accepted the Respondent’s assurances regarding her use of alcohol and benzodiazepines but advised her to go along with PRN’s requirements, even if they included drug and alcohol screening, because they would not last long if what she was telling him was true.  46. The Respondent executed a new licensure-long contract with PRN on or about August 2, 2016. It included requirements for drug and alcohol screening, as well as psychotherapy that had been dropped or reduced from the requirements in her previous PRN contract. Soon after signing the new contract, the Respondent realized that her financial responsibilities for drug and alcohol screening and for the psychotherapy were daunting, as were the time and travel burdens of the psychotherapy, and she stopped complying with the terms of her new contract. PRN terminated the contract on or about October 13, 2016.  47. While this case was pending, the Respondent again attempted to re-enter PRN, and she was evaluated by Dr. Brian Gadbois, a board-certified psychiatrist, on or about July 18, 2017.  48. Dr. Gadbois testified that, while not everyone with  bipolar disorder should be prevented from practicing medicine,  15 2. There is competent substantial evidence to support the findings of fact.  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  1. The Board has jurisdiction of this matter pursuant to Section 120.57(1), Florida Statutes, and Chapter 458, Florida Statutes.  2. The conclusions of law set forth in the Recommended Order are approved and adopted and incorporated herein by reference.  PENALTY  Upon a complete review of the record in this case, the Board determines that the penalty recommended by the Administrative Law Judge be ACCEPTED. WHEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED AND ADJUDGED:  1. Respondent shall pay an administrative fine in the amount of $1,000.00 to the Board within six months from the date Respondent’s license to practice medicine is reinstated. Said fine shall be paid by money order or cashier’s check.  2. Respondent’s license to practice medicine in the State of Florida is hereby SUSPENDED until such time as she demonstrates the ability to practice medicine with reasonable skill and safety. Such demonstration of skill and safety shall include an evaluation by the Professionals Resource Network  (PRN). The Respondent shall appear before the Board with said 40927  the Respondent’s circumstances are unique because her bipolar condition is not consistently well-managed, and her bipolar disorder causes her to suffer from serious cognitive deficiencies. As a result, he opined that she is not able to practice medicine with reasonable skill and safety, and that her patients would be at serious risk of harm due to her poor medical decision-making skills. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  49. Because DOH seeks to impose license discipline, it has the burden to prove its allegations by clear and convincing evidence. See Dep’t of Banking & Fin. v. Osborne Stern & Co., Inc., 670 So. 2d 932 (Fla. 1996); Ferris v. Turlington, 510 So. 2d 292 (Fla. 1987). This “entails both a qualitative and quantitative standard. The evidence must be credible; the memories of the witnesses must be clear and without confusion; and the sum total of the evidence must be of sufficient weight to  convince the trier of fact without hesitancy.” In re Davey,  645 So. 2d 398, 404 (Fla. 1994). See also Slomowitz v. Walker, 429 So. 2d 797, 800 (Fla. 4th DCA 1983). “Although this standard of proof may be met where the evidence is in conflict, . .. it  seems to preclude evidence that is ambiguous.” Westinghouse  Elec. Corp. v. Shuler Bros., Inc., 590 So. 2d 986, 988 (Fla. 1st  DCA 1991).  16 40928  The Charges and Proof  50. Count I of the Amended Administrative Complaint charged the Respondent with violating section 456.072(1) (hh), Florida Statutes (2013), by being terminated from her contract with PRN for failing to comply with the requirements of her contract with PRN, without good cause. DOH proved this charge by clear and convincing evidence. Under her PRN contract, the Respondent was required to provide updated contact information. She also was required to submit quarterly reports from her psychiatrist. She failed to comply with these requirements. The Respondent offered excuses and explanations for her failure to comply, but they did not constitute good cause for non-compliance.  S1. Count II of the Amended Administrative Complaint charged the Respondent with violating section 458.331(1) (x), Florida Statutes (2013).  52. Section 458.331(1) (x) made violating a lawful order of the Board a ground for denial of a license or disciplinary action, as specified in section 456.072(2).  53. Board final orders required the Respondent to: undergo an evaluation by PRN; comply with any recommendations made by PRN; enter into a PRN contract, if recommended; and comply with all terms of the contract.  54. DOH proved by clear and convincing evidence that the  Respondent violated section 458.331(1) (x) by failing to comply  17 40929  with all terms of her PRN contract, in direct violation of Board final orders.  55. Count III of the Amended Administrative Complaint charged the Respondent with violating section 458.331(1)(s), Florida Statutes (2014).  56. Section 458.331(1) (s) provided, in pertinent part:  The following acts constitute grounds for  denial of a license or disciplinary action,  as specified in s. 456.072(2):  (s) Being unable to practice medicine with  reasonable skill and safety to patients by  reason of illness or use of alcohol, drugs,  narcotics, chemicals, or any other type of  material or as a result of any mental or  physical condition. That version of the statute remains in effect, and Count III pertains to the Respondent’s present ability to practice medicine under the 2017 version of the Florida Statutes.  57. DOH proved Count III by clear and convincing evidence. The Respondent does not dispute that she is bipolar type I; that she must remain under psychiatric care; that she must take the medication prescribed for her for that condition; that she is not able to practice medicine with reasonable skill and safety without a PRN contract; and that she needs retraining, which is not practical or feasible at this time. She disputed some of the other mental conditions that were diagnosed and the need for drug  and alcohol screening and psychotherapy in her PRN contract. She  is attempting to require PRN to reinstate her previous contract;  18 40930  ignore other subsequent diagnoses of her mental condition as a result of the evaluations by Drs. Sylvester, Wilson, and Gadbois; and eliminate the need for alcohol or drug screening or psychotherapy.  58. The Respondent first contended that those evaluations should not have been performed at all because she was not terminated from her previous PRN contract for non-compliance without good cause. The premise for that contention has been rejected.  59. The Respondent next contended that those evaluations should be ignored because she agreed to them under duress. Clearly, she now regrets agreeing to them and would like to turn back the clock, undo her decisions, and avoid the consequences of those evaluations. But she agreed to them in order to enter a new PRN contract. She may well have felt she had no other good options at the time, but she was not under legal duress, and cannot avoid the consequences of the evaluations on that ground.  60. Finally, the Respondent devoted significant time and energy on independent legal research into the ADA. As a result, she argued that the questions asked by the medical professionals who evaluated her for DOH after 2013 were illegal. Based on that argument, she moved to dismiss the charges; exclude the opinions of Drs. Sylvester, Wilson, and Gadbois; and force the  reinstatement of her previous PRN contract.  19 40931  The Respondent’s ADA Argument Fails  61. A public entity is not required to permit an individual to participate in, or benefit from, the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages and accommodations of a public accommodation, if that individual poses a direct threat to the  health or safety of others. ACLU of Ind. v. Individual Members  of the Ind. State Bd. of Law Exam’rs, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  106337, at *18 (S.D. Ind. Sept. 20, 2011) (citing language from  Bodenstab v. Cnty. of Cook, 569 F.3d 651, 658 (7th Cir. 2009).  62. The Florida Legislature recognized, through its enactment of section 458.301, Florida Statutes, that the practice of medicine is potentially dangerous to the public if conducted by unsafe or incompetent practitioners. “It is the legislative intent that physicians who fall below minimum competency or who otherwise present a danger to the public shall be prohibited from practicing in this state.” Id.  63. The Florida Supreme Court has also recognized the  danger an unsafe physician can pose to the public. The Court in  Boedy v. Department of Professional Regulation, 463 So. 2d 215,  217 (Fla. 1985), found:  The right of a properly qualified and licensed individual to practice medicine is a valuable property right which must be protected under the constitution and laws of Florida. State ex rel. Sbordy v. Rowlett, 138 Fla. 330, 190 So. 59 (1939). This right is not absolute, however, but is subject to regulation under the police power of this  20  40932  state. Id. at 62. When a conflict arises between the right of a physician to pursue the medical profession and the right of the sovereignty to protect its citizenry, it follows that the rights of the physician must yield to the power of the state to prescribe reasonable rules and regulations which will protect the people from incompetent and unfit practitioners.  The interest of the sovereignty in regulating physicians is especially great since physicians are in a position of public trust and responsibility. Like other professionals, the physician is constantly interacting with the public. As such, mental fitness and emotional stability are essential traits that a physician must possess in order to competently practice medicine in a manner not injurious to the citizenry. See Florida Board of Bar Examiners Re: Applicant, 443  So. 2d 71 (Fla.1983).  64. A public entity may require an individualized assessment, of a licensee with a disability if the licensee poses  a direct threat to the health and safety of others. Theriault v.  Flynn, 162 F.3d 46, 48-49 (lst Cir. 1998). In doing so, however, the public entity must ensure that it complies with all applicable state and federal laws. 65. The Respondent alleges that the Board failed to meet  its obligations under Title II of the ADA. The First Circuit Court of Appeals case of Theriault v. Flynn succinctly states the Board’s obligations under the ADA:  Federal regulations explicitly forbid public  entities from “administer[ing] a licensing or  certification program in a manner that  subjects qualified individuals with disabilities to discrimination on the basis  21  40933  of disability.” See 28 C.F.R. 35.130(b) (6). In the context of licensing or certification, a person is “qualified” and thus within the protected category if he or she can meet the “essential eligibility requirements” for receiving a license or certification, with accommodation made for the disability. See 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2); 28 C.F.R. pt. 35, app. A, at 472 (1997); Applicants v. Texas State Bd. of Law, 1994 WL 923404, at (W.D. Tex. Oct. 11, 1994).  In determining whether “essential eligibility requirements” are met, a public entity properly may consider whether an applicant with a disability poses a direct threat to the health and safety of others. See  28 C.F.R. pt. 35, app. A, at 472-73 (1997); Id. at § 36.208(c). See also Bragdon v. Abbott, 524 U.S. 624, ----, 118 S. Ct. 2196, 2210, 141 L. Ed. 2d 540 (1998) (involving Title III of the ADA) (noting the need to balance the interests of individuals with disabilities against legitimate concerns for public safety); School Board of Nassau County v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273, 287, 107 S. Ct.  1123, 94 L. Ed. 2d 307 (1987) (involving the Rehabilitation Act) (relied on in Bragdon).  Theriault v. Flynn, 162 F.3d 46, 48-49 (lst Cir. 1998).  66. The determination that a person poses a threat may not be based on generalizations or stereotypes about the effects of a particular disability. Instead, it must be based on an individualized assessment, and reasonable judgment that relies on current medical evidence, or the best available objective evidence, to determine: the nature, duration, and severity of the risk; the probability that the potential injury will actually occur; and whether reasonable modifications of policies,  practices, or procedures will mitigate the risk. ACLU of Ind. v.  22 40934  Individual Members of the Ind. State Bd. of Law Exam’rs, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 106337, at *18-19.  67. In this case, the Board did not act based on generalizations or stereotypes when it required the Respondent to undergo evaluations. Rather, it has acted based on particular and specific allegations of harm to the public in the form of nine malpractice allegations in a short period of time.  68. Participation in and continued compliance with the PRN program is a reasonable accommodation for the Respondent’s mental condition.  69. The PRN requirement was not imposed on the Respondent based on generalizations or stereotypes about the effects of the Respondent’s bipolar disorder. It was related to the nine specific instances of medical malpractice committed by the Respondent between March 2001 and January 2003. The allegations against the Respondent constituted grounds for discipline against the Respondent’s license, with penalties up to and including revocation of her medical license. The Board’s final orders attempted to accommodate the Respondent’s bipolar condition and enable her to maintain her license, while also fulfilling the Board’s obligation to ensure the safety of the public. The Respondent is not safe to practice medicine without a PRN  contract.  23  40935  70. Enrollment in an impaired practitioner treatment program is a reasonable accommodation under the ADA, so long as the practitioner enrolls and progresses satisfactorily in the program and does not constitute a threat to the public. See  ‘Blair v. Bureau of Prof’l & Occupational Affairs, State Bd. of Nursing, 72 A.3d 742, 753 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 2013).  71. The Respondent has the opportunity to demonstrate her fitness to resume the practice of medicine at reasonable intervals. § 458.331(1)(s), Fla. Stat. The Florida Supreme Court in Boedy noted this opportunity as a reason for upholding the state’s police power in ordering mental examinations of physicians. Boedy, 463 So. 2d at 218.  72. The subsequent evaluations in this case are analogous to those required in Theriault v. Flynn, 162 F.3d 46, 49 (1st Cir. 1998). In that case, the Plaintiff, Mr. Theriault, alleged that the New Hampshire Department of Safety violated his rights by requiring him to take a third road test to renew his driver’s license. Id. Mr. Theriault did not dispute that his cerebral palsy limited the use of his hands; however, Mr. Theriault argued that his condition was the same or possibly improved since the previous road test he passed. Id. The court found that the Department of Safety’s “asking [Mr. Theriault] to demonstrate  that he remained qualified to drive was not only permissible but  24  40936  also the state’s obligation in balancing the rights of the disabled.” Id.  73. Likewise, the Respondent does not dispute having a disabling mental condition. Based on that condition, PRN lawfully required the Respondent to be re-evaluated to either demonstrate her current ability to practice medicine safely or to facilitate PRN creating appropriate monitoring terms if the Respondent was not safe to practice. Such subsequent, periodic testing is similar to that approved in Theriault.  74. To support her position, the Respondent cited various cases that discuss questions on licensing applications, including: Clark v. Virginia Bd. of Bar Examiners, 880 F. Supp. 430 (E.D. Va. 1995); and Medical Society of New Jersey v. Jacobs, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14294 (D.N.J. Oct. 5, 1993).  75. The cases cited by the Respondent are readily distinguishable in that they address application questions that could rule out applicants prospectively based on generalizations or stereotypes and not based on actual harm or threat of harm. The requirement that the Respondent be evaluated, and her subsequent 2005 contract with PRN, arose from nine malpractice allegations in a short period of time. The Board’s requirement met the obligations outlined by Theriault and was a reasonable  accommodation for the Respondent’s mental illness.  25  PRN evaluation and the Board shall make the determination of whether Respondent is safe to practice medicine with reasonable skill and safety. The Board retains jurisdiction in this matter to impose terms and conditions upon reinstatement of Respondent’s license, including, but not limited to, a period of probation with said terms and conditions to be set at the time of reinstatement.  3. Respondent shall be and hereby is REPRIMANDED by the Board.  RULING ON MOTION TO ASSESS COSTS  The Board reviewed the Petitioner’s Motion to Assess Costs and imposes the costs associated with this case in the amount of $71,170.16. Said costs are to be paid within 6 months of reinstatement of Respondent’s license to practice medicine.  (NOTE: SHE RULE 64B8-8.0011, FLORIDA ADMINISTRATIVE CODE. UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED BY FINAL ORDER, THE RULE SETS FORTH THE REQUIREMENTS FOR PERFORMANCE OF ALL PENALTIES CONTAINED IN THIS FINAL  ORDER. )  DONE AND ORDERED this Ze) day of r  2018.  BOARD OF MEDICINE  Claudia Kemp, J.D., Executive Director  For Jorge J. Lopez, M.D., Chair 40937  76. Even in the case of license applicants, questions from public entities inquiring about diagnoses for serious mental ilinesses, including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, paranoia, or “any other psychotic disorder,” have been upheld by the courts against Title II scrutiny. Applicants v. Tex. State Bd. of Law Exam’rs, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21290 (W.D. Tex. Oct. 11, 1994) (upholding limited inquiry into whether applicant has been diagnosed with or treated for “bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, paranoia, or any other psychotic disorder” within the last ten years); O’Brien v. Va. Bd. of Bar Exam’rs, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4344 (E.D. Va. Jan. 23, 1998) (denying preliminary injunction from asking an applicant questions about mental health diagnoses in the last five years).  77. The courts have determined that public entities have a sound basis for crafting temporally broad questions regarding serious mental illnesses because serious mental illnesses tend to recur throughout a person’s lifetime. ACLU of Ind. v. Individual Members of the Ind. State Bd. of Law Examiners, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 106337, at *24.  78. Courts have held that bipolar disorder is a serious mental illness, and due to the unpredictable nature of the 1liness, inquiry into past diagnosis and treatment of bipolar  disorder is necessary to provide the Board with the best  26 40938  information available with which to assess the functional capacity of the individual. Id.  79. The evaluations of the Respondent were lawful under the ADA and met the criteria established by the courts in Theriault and ACLU of Indiana.  The Appropriate Disposition  80. It would be the Respondent’s first preference to avoid the financial and other consequences of participation in PRN by simply having her medical license restricted to prohibit her from patient care. She believes that would enable her to obtain gainful employment with the federal Social Security Administration as a medical reviewer and reduce or eliminate her need to be on disability. Assuming that is the case, the Respondent’s proposal might serve to protect the public from unsafe practice, but it would not be an appropriate outcome. It would be like having a medical license that prohibits the practice of medicine, which is defined as “the diagnosis, treatment, operation, or prescription for any human disease, pain, injury, deformity, or other physical or mental condition.” § 458.305(3), Fla. Stat. (2017).  81. If her first preference is not available, the Respondent would concede that she should not be allowed to practice medicine unless she is under contract with PRN.  However, she would prefer to have her previous PRN contract  27 40939  reinstated. This would eliminate the need for drug and alcohol screening and psychotherapy. It appears that those things may well be unnecessary for the Respondent and that PRN could eliminate them. However, it would not be appropriate based on this evidentiary record to order PRN to do so, or to ignore the Respondent’s more recent evaluations.  82. Florida Administrative Code Rule 64B8-8.001 provides notice of the range of disciplinary penalties that could be imposed for violations of sections 456.072 and 458.331, Florida Statutes. The rule also provides aggravating and mitigating factors to consider should a penalty outside the disciplinary guidelines be recommended. Among those factors is the likelihood that a patient or the public could be exposed to injury or death, and the disciplinary history of the licensee. Fla. Admin. Code R. 64B8-8.001 (3) (a).  83. In 2013 when the violation alleged in Count I occurred, the penalties authorized for a violation of section 456.072(1) (bh) ranged from suspension until licensee demonstrates compliance with all terms of the monitoring or treatment contract, and the ability to practice with reasonable skill and safety, to be followed by a term of probation, and a fine of $1,000 to $2,500, to revocation. Fla. Admin. Code R. 64B8-  8.001(2) (ww) (May 28, 2012).  28  40940  84. In 2013 when the violation alleged in Count II occurred, the penalties authorized for a violation of section 458.331(1) (x) ranged from reprimand and an administrative fine from $5,000.00 to $10,000.00, to revocation or denial, based upon the severity of the offense and the potential for patient harm. Fla. Admin. Code R. 64B8-8.001(2) (x)2. (May 28, 2012).  85. The penalties authorized for the violation of section 458.331(1)(s) alleged in Count III range from probation, to denial or indefinite suspension until the licensee is able to demonstrate ability to practice with reasonable skill and safety followed by probation, and an administrative fine from $1,000.00 to $5,000.00. Fla. Admin. Code R. 64B8-8.001(s) (November 9, 2016).  86. In its proposed recommended order, DOH requested the penalty of a reprimand, a $1,000 administrative fine, and license suspension until such time as the Respondent demonstrates her ability to practice medicine with reasonable skill and safety, with such demonstration to include an evaluation by PRN, if required by PRN. This result seems reasonable and appropriate, based on the evidence in this case. However, in evaluating the Respondent and the need for monitoring, PRN should consider carefully whether drug and alcohol screening and psychotherapy is  necessary.  29  40941  RECOMMENDATION  Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, it is RECOMMENDED that the Board of Medicine enter a final order:  1. Finding that the Respondent violated sections 456.072 (1) (hh), 458.331(1) (x), and 458.331(1)(s), Florida Statutes, as charged in the Amended Administrative Complaint;  2. Issuing a reprimand against the Respondent's medical license;  3.0 Imposing an administrative fine of $1,000.00;  4. Suspending Respondent’s medical license until such time as she demonstrates to the Board her ability to practice medicine with reasonable skill and safety, with such demonstration to include an evaluation by PRN, if required by PRN; and  5. Reserving jurisdiction to impose additional terms and conditions, including a period of probation with terms and conditions to be determined by the Board at the time of  reinstatement of the Respondent’s license to practice medicine.  30 40942  DONE AND ENTERED this 8th day of January, 2018, in  Tallahassee, Leon County, Florida.  fae feat  J.

DOH Case Number 2013-12198  DOAH Case Number 17-2923PL Grace Guastella, M.D.,  Respondent.  /  MOTION TO ASSESS COSTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 456.072(4)  The Department of Health, by and through counsel, moves the Board of Medicine for entry of a Final Order assessing costs against Respondent for the investigation and prosecution of this case in accordance with Section 456.072(4), Florida Statutes (2013-2017). As grounds therefore, the Petitioner states the following:  1.  Atits next regularly scheduled meeting, the Board of Medicine will take up for consideration the above-styled disciplinary action and will enter a Final Order.  2. Section 456.072(4), Florida Statutes (2013-2017), states, in  pertinent part, as follows:  43079  In addition to any other discipline imposed through final order, or citation, entered on or after July 1, 2001, under this section or discipline imposed through final order, or citation, entered on or after July 1, 2001, for a violation of any practice act, the board, or the department when there is no board, shall assess costs related to the investigation and prosecution of the case. The costs related to the investigation and prosecution include, but are not limited to, salaries and benefits of personnel, costs related to the time spent by the attorney and other personnel working on the case, and any other expenses incurred by the department for the case. The board, or the department when there is no board, shall determine the amount of costs to be assessed after its consideration of an affidavit of itemized costs and any written objections thereto. ...  3. As evidenced in the attached affidavit (Exhibit A), the investigation and prosecution of this case has resulted in costs in the total amount of $71,595.34, based on the following itemized statement of costs:  Total costs for Complaint $82.33 Total costs for Investigation $2,309.28 Total costs for Legal $52,796.84  Total costs for Compliance $9.28 Total costs for Expenses $16,397.61  paoom  4, The attached outside attorney affidavit (Exhibit B) indicates a review of the file and a finding that the Department's attorney time in this  case is reasonable and justifiable in the amount of $52,371.66.*  1 The Department incurred $425.18 in legal costs after the outside attorney’s review, which  is why the legal costs in Exhibit A are higher. The Department is not seeking the additional $425.18 in costs, as those costs were not reviewed by the outside attorney.  43080  5, Upon review of the file, the Department contends that the costs associated with attorney time spent on this case are reasonable and justifiable.  6. Should Respondent file written objections to the assessment of costs, within ten (10) days of the date of this motion, specifying the grounds for the objections and the specific elements of the costs to which objections are made, Petitioner requests that the Board determine the amount of costs to be assessed based upon its consideration of the affidavits attached as Exhibits A and B and any timely-filed written objections.  7. Petitioner requests that the Board grant this motion and assess costs in the amount of $71,170.16 as supported by competent, substantial evidence. This assessment of costs is in addition to any other discipline imposed by the Board and is in accordance with Section 456.072(4), Florida Statutes (2013-2017).  WHEREFORE, the Department of Health requests that the Board of Medicine enter a Final Order assessing costs against Respondent in the amount of $71,170.16.

Chad Duca Chad Dunn Assistant General Counsel 43082  AFFIDAVIT OF FEES AND COSTS EXPENDED  STATE OF FLORIDA COUNTY OF LEON:  BEFORE ME, the undersigned authority, personally appeared SHANE WALTERS who was sworn and states as follows:  1) 2)  3)  5)  7  —  © —  My name is Shane Walters.  | am over the age of 18, competent to testify, and make this affidavit upon my own personal knowledge and after review of the records at the Florida Department of Health (DOH).  | am the Operations and Management Consultant Manager (OMCM) for the Consumer Services and Compliance Management Unit for DOH. The Consumer Services Unit is where all complaints against Florida health care licensees (e.g., medical doctors, dentists, nurses, respiratory therapists) are officially filed. | have been in my current job position for more than one year. My business address is 4052 Bald Cypress Way, Bin C-75 Tallahassee, Florida 32399-3275.  As OMCM of the Consumer Services and Compliance Management Unit, my job duties include reviewing data in the Time Tracking System and verifying that the amounts correspond. The Time Tracking System is a computer program which records and tracks DOH’s costs regarding the investigation and prosecution of cases against Florida health care licensees.  As of today, DOH’s total costs for investigating and prosecuting DOH case number(s) 2013-12197 (Department of Health v. Grace Mary Guastella, M.D.) are SEVENTY-ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED NINETY-FIVE DOLLARS AND THIRTY-FOUR CENTS ($71, 595.34).  The costs for DOH case numbers 2013-12197 (Department of Health v. Grace Mary Guastella, M.D.) are summarized in Exhibit 1 (Cost Summary Report), which is attached to this document.  The itemized cosis and expenses for DOH case numbers 2013-12197 (Department of Health v. Grace Mary Guastella, M.D.) are detailed in Exhibit 2 (Itemized Cost Report and Itemized Expense Report and receipts), which is attached to this document.  The itemized costs as reflected in Exhibit 2 are determined by the  following method: DOH employees who work on cases daily are to keep track of their time in six-minute increments (e.g., investigators  ior Balak * ~~  Name of Notary Printed  and lawyers). A designated DOH employee in the Consumer Services Unit, Legal Department, and in each area office, inputs the time worked and expenses spent into the Time Tracking System. Time and expenses are charged against a state health care Board (e.g., Florida Board of Medicine, Florida Board of Dentistry, Florida Board of Osteopathic Medicine), and/or a case. If no Board or case can be charged, then the time and expenses are charged as administrative time. The hourly rate of each employee is calculated by formulas established by the Department. (See the Itemized Cost Report)  Shane Walters, first being duly sworn, states that he has read the foregoing Affidavit and its attachments and the statements contained therein are true and correct to the best of his knowledge and belief.
