5. `dea_case` (int): 1 if the case involves the Drug Enforcement Agency, 0 otherwise. -1 if unsure.
6. `improper_opioid_prescription` (int): 1 if the doctor improperly prescribed opioids, 0 otherwise. -1 if unsure.
7. `improper_drug_prescription` (int): 1 if the doctor improperly prescribed any drugs (including opioids), 0 otherwise. -1 if unsure.
8. `unfit_to_practice` (int): 1 if the doctor got into unrelated legal trouble resulting in action being taken against their license, 0 otherwise. -1 if unsure.
9. `bad_medical_records` (int): 1 if the doctor failed to maintain adequate medical records, 0 otherwise. -1 if unsure.
10. `license_issues` (int): 1 if the doctor faced administrative issues with their license, 0 otherwise. -1 if unsure. Voluntary relinquishment should be marked as 0.

13. `no_substantive_information` (int): 1 if there is no substantive information in the case text regarding the doctor's violation, 0 otherwise. -1 if unsure.
14. `proactive` (int): 1 if someone else (agency, lawsuit, etc) got the doctor in trouble first, before the state medical board, 0 otherwise. -1 if unsure.
