On or about February 26, 2011, Patient A.E., an 83 year-old male, fell at home and developed severe and worsening low back pain.  6. On or about March 5 and 8, 2011, MRI's of Patient A.E’s lumbar and thoracic regions revealed a compression fracture with edema: at the T-11 level. ,  7. Patient A.E. was referred to Respondent for a T-11 vertebroplasty. ) ,  8. Vertebroplasty is a spinal procedure where bone cement is injected through a small hole in the skin into a fractured vertebra with the goal of relieving the pain of vertebral compression fractures.  9. On or about March 10, 2011, at The Watson Clinic in Lakeland, Florida, Respondent performed a vertebroplasty at what he believed to be Patient A.E.'s T-11 vertebra. |  10. On or about March 10, 2011, Respondent attempted to  ascertain Patient A.E.’s T-11 vertebra by counting down from a  4132 thoracolumbar kyphosis (over-curvature of the vertebra) at Patient A.E.'s T- 1 vertebra. ,  , 11. Subsequent to Patient A.E.'s discharge, Patient A.E. notified Respondent that he, Patient A.E., was experiencing no improvement in his back pain symptoms. ,  12. On or about March 15, 2011, Patient A.E. underwent an MRI which revealed that Respondent had performed the vertebroplasty at Patient A.E.'s T-12 vertebra (the wrong level).  13. On or about March 16, 2011, Respondent met with Patient A.E. and his family and explained his error, stating that the kyphos at T-1 straightened slightly when Patient A.E. was placed in the prone position changing what appeared to be a fixed landmark which he had used to count to the T-11 level.  14.

On or about March 10, 201 1, Respondent performed a wrong- site procedure by performing a vertebroplasty on Patient A.E. at the T-12 level (wrong site) rather than at the T-11 level (correct site).  18. Based on the foregoing, Respondent has violated Section 456.072(1)(bb), Florida Statutes (2010), by performing or attempting to perform health care services on the wrong patient, a wrong-site procedure, a wrong procedure, or an unauthorized procedure or a procedure that is medically unnecessary or otherwise unrelated to the patient’s diagnosis or medical condition.

Petitioner is the state department charged with regulating the practice of medicine pursuant to Section 20.43, Florida Statutes; Chapter 456, Florida Statutes; and Chapter 458, Florida Statutes.  2. At all times material to this Complaint, Respondent was a licensed physician within the state of Florida, having been issued license number ME 39592.  3. | Respondent's address of record is 8890 West Oakland Park Blvd., Suite 300, Sunrise, Florida 33351.  J:\PSU\MEDICAL\DAVID PIUS\CASES\LEONARD 07-32189\AC_LEONARD_07-32189.D0C 4, At all times material to this Complaint, Respondent engaged in the practice of medicine as an Ophthalmologist, and is Board Certified in Cataract and Implant Surgery.  5. The Respondent first diagnosed patient W.B., a fifty-two year- old male, with cataracts in both eyes in 2007. The Respondent recommended implanting a new type of intra-ocular lens (IOL), called a Crystalens®, which was expected to correct W.B.’s cataracts and eliminate his need for reading glasses as well. The surgery was performed on W.B.’s left eye on August 7, 2007.  6. After the procedure, W.B. reported improved vision for reading and computer use, but reported that his distance vision was still blurry.  ‘ie Respondent contacted the lens manufacturer, as well as colleagues using the Crystalens® IOL, to discuss why patient W.B. did not have a better result, to determine whether implanting a Crystalens® in the right eye was advisable, and if it was, how to achieve a better result.  8. It was decided that the Respondent would implant a +18.0 diopter Crystalens® in W.B/s right eye, and if there was no posterior vaulting, exchange it for a +19.0 diopter one.  9. Onor about September 11, 2007, patient W.B. was admitted to Foundation For Advanced Eye Care (FFAEC) for the scheduled cataract surgery of his right eye.  J:\PSU\MEDICAL\DAVID PIUS\CASES\LEONARD 07-32189\AC_LEONARD_07-32189.DOC 2 10. The two different powers of Crystalens® were available in the operating room for implantation, with determination of the correct power to be made just prior to implantation.  11. During the surgery Respondent placed the +18.0 diopter lens, completed the surgery, and sent W.B. to the post-anesthesia recovery room (PAR). While he was still in the PAR, the Respondent realized that she had become confused as to the appropriate lens to use given her intraoperative clinical findings, and that the +19.0 diopter lens should have been implanted.  12. The Respondent discussed the error with W.B. while he was still in the PAR and he consented to a return to the operating room so the incorrect +18.0 lens could be removed and the correct +19.0 lens could be implanted. This was done without incident, and W.B. reportedly healed well from the surgery.  13. Section 456.072(1)(bb), Florida Statutes (2007), provides that performing or attempting to perform health care services on the wrong patient, a wrong-site procedure, a wrong procedure, or an unauthorized procedure, or a procedure that is medically unnecessary or otherwise unrelated to the patient's diagnosis or medical condition, constitutes  grounds for discipline by the Board of Medicine.  J:\PSU\MEDICAL\DAVID PIUS\CASES\LEONARD 07-32189\AC_LEONARD_07-32189.DOC 3 14. Respondent inserted a +18.0 diopter lens into patient W.B.‘s right eye instead of the intended +19.0 diopter lens.  15. Based on the foregoing, Respondent violated Section 456.072(1)(bb), Florida Statutes (2007), by performing a wrong procedure.  16. WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that the Board of Medicine enter an order imposing one or more of the following penalties: permanent revocation or suspension of Respondent's license, restriction of practice, imposition of an administrative fine, issuance of a reprimand, placement of Respondent on probation, corrective action and/or any other  relief that the Board deems appropriate.

On or about April 12, 2006, prior Patient G.S.'s admission to | Jackson Hospital, he underwent a CT scan of the right hip, which revealed severely advanced degenerative joint disease in the right hip, with protrusio acetabuli (when the acetabulum (socket) is too deep and may protrude into the pelvis) and severe erosive changes.  6. On or about August 7, 2006, Respondent performed surgery on Patient G.S., who had a preoperative diagnosis of severe osteoporosis and degenerative arthritis of the right hip.  7. The initial consented procedure for the August 7, 2006, surgery on Patient G.S. was a right total arthroplasty (the operative formation or restoration of a joint).  8.

Furthermore, if there are  any ambiguities included such must be construed in favor of the applicant or  licensee.” Id. at 925. In this case, the ALJ seeks to hold Respondent accountable  for documentation created by others, finding that he was responsible for reviewing  and correcting any discrepancies in these records created by the circulators. That  is not conduct that is included within the scope of Section 458.331(1)(m), Florida  Statutes, and Respondent may not be found guilty of a violation of this statute  based on the findings of fact in the AC.  For the reasons set forth above, paragraphs 69, 92 and 93 should be amended  to state:  69. The evidence and testimony in this case fails to establish that Respondent created the records documenting the concentration of tumescent solution used in these cases, or that he was responsible for creating these records.  92. The Administrative Complaint in this case fails to alleged any facts that constitute a medical records violation. Thus, no medical records violation may be found in this case. Even if this violation were appropriately pled, Petitioner did not prove by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent failed to create or maintain medical records that accurately reflected the amount of epinephrine administered to Patients L.L., D.M., N.F., and P.N.  93. Asaresult, Petitioner failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated section 458.331(1)(m).  Page 56 of 58 AGGRAVATING FACTORS AND PENALTY  In paragraph 100, the ALJ discusses aggravating and mitigating factors she found in this case to support her penalty recommendation. The ALJ improperly found Subsection (h) of Rule 64B8-8.001(3), Florida Administrative Code, was an aggravating factor in this case. Subsection (h) of that rule states that it can be considered aggravation if a licensee who is a records owner commits a standard of care violation and fails to produce medical records. No evidence or testimony was provided regarding whether Respondent was a records owner in this case, but it is clear that the records were requested from and obtained from the clinics, not from Respondent. He is not the records owner of the records in these cases. Moreover, the records were kept and produced by the records owner. The finding that this is an aggravating factor in this case should be rejected and stricken, and any penalty adjusted accordingly.  RECOMMENDATION  The Respondent requests that a Final Order be entered finding that Respondent did not commit the violations alleged in the Second Amended Administrative Complaint, and dismissing the Complaint. If the exceptions are not accepted, and discipline is imposed for one or more violations, Respondent requests that the penalty be adjusted to reflect only any violations found in this  case, and without the aggravating factor discussed above. Finally, Respondent  Page 57 of 58 requests a separate hearing to discuss the costs of the investigation and prosecution of this case. Sincerely, RODRIGUEZ & PERRY, P.A.

OSAKATUKEI O. OMULEPU, M.D., RESPONDENT. a |  MOTION TO BIFURCATE AND RETAIN JURISDICTION TO ASSESS COSTS  IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 456.072(4), FLORIDA STATUTES (2016)  The Department of Health, by and through undersigned counsel requests the Board of Medicine (“Board”) enter an Order bifurcating the issue of costs and retaining jurisdiction to assess costs, against Respondent for the investigation and prosecution of this case in accordance with Section 456.072(4), Florida Statutes (2016). Petitioner states the following in support of the request:  1. At its next regularly scheduled meeting, the Board will take up for consideration the above-styled disciplinary action and will  enter a Final Order therein.  2. Pursuant to Section 120.569(2)(1), Florida Statutes (2015), the final order in a proceeding heard by an administrative law judge, which affects a party's substantial interests, must be rendered within ninety days after a Recommended Order is submitted to an agency, unless the ninety days is waived by the Respondent.  3. The Administrative Law Judge's Recommended Order was submitted to the agency on or about January 6, 2017. Ninety days from this date is on or about Apri 7, 2017. The Board of Medicine Meeting is scheduled April 6-7, 2017.  4. Section 456.072(4), Florida Statutes (2016), states as follows:  In addition to any other discipline imposed through final order, or citation, entered on or after July 1,  2001, pursuant to this section or discipline imposed through final order, or citation, entered on or after July 1, 2001, for a violation of any practice act, the board, or the department when there is not board, shall assess costs related to the investigation and prosecution of the case. The costs _ related to the investigation and prosecution include, but are not limited to, salaries and benefits of personnel, costs related to the time spent by the attorney and other personnel working on the case, and any other expenses incurred by the department for the case. The board, or the department when there is  no board, shall determine the amount of costs to be assessed after its consideration of an_ affidavit of itemized costs and any written objections thereto... (emphasis added)  5. In order for the Board to assess costs against the Respondent, under the current case law, the Department is required to obtain an outside expert attorney opinion verifying the reasonableness of the time spent by the Departments attorneys on this matter or the amount of fees sought. Georges v. Dept of Health, 75 So. 3d 759 (Fla. 2d DCA 2011).  6. In order for the Board to assess costs against the Respondent, under the current case law, the Department is also required to verify attorneys’ time spent on a case and prepare supporting affidavits for the amount of attorneys’ time sought to be recovered. Georges v. Dept of Health, 75 So. 3d 759 (Fla. 2d DCA 2011).  7. There is insufficient time for the Department to verify its attorney’s time spent on the case; prepare supporting affidavits for the amount of attorney’s time sought to be recovered; and obtain an outside expert attorney opinion verifying the reasonableness of the time spent by  the Department's attorney on this matter or the amount of fees sought.  8. The bifurcation of the issue of cost recovery by the Department to a later date will not cause any undue hardship to the Respondent as it will delay, rather than expedite, the date at which a final order on the assessment of cost would be entered against Respondent, and thus  delay the date upon which any payment for costs would be due and owing.  9. Petitioner requests that the Board grant this motion, bifurcate the issue of assessmentof costs and retain jurisdiction to assess costs against Respondent once the Department has obtained an outside expert attorney opinion verifying the reasonableness of the time spent by the Department's attorney on this matter or the amount of fees sought, obtains supporting affidavits for the amount of attorney’s time sought to be recovered and brings a motion to assess costs before the Board of Medicine.  WHEREFORE the Department of Health requests that the Board of Medicine enter an Order bifurcating the issue of cost assessment and  retaining jurisdiction to assess costs against Respondent.

On April 29, 2015, prior to her procedure, Patient D.M.  underwent bloodwork that revealed she had a normal hematocrit level, normal hemoglobin level, and a normal red blood cell count.  15. Also prior to her procedure, Patient D.M. indicated in her medical questionnaire that she was pregnant approximately five times.  16. Because Patient D.M. disclosed her prior pregnancies to Respondent, Respondent knew, or should have known, that Patient D.M. had a potentially weak or thin abdominal wall.  17. Respondent determined that Patient D.M. was of sufficiently good health to be an appropriate candidate to undergo liposuction with gluteal fat transfer.  18. Respondent performed liposuction with gluteal fat transfer on Patient D.M. at Spectrum on May 15, 2015.  19. Following the surgery, Patient D.M. experienced extreme pain, resulting in her admission to Westchester Hospital.  20. Upon admission, Patient D.M.'s hematology report revealed a low hematocrit and low hemoglobin, which signified severely diminished blood levels and necessitated her to be transfused with three units of blood.  21. During an exploratory surgery, Patient D.M. was found to have several holes in her liver and damage to her chest and  abdominal wall.  Facts Related to Patient N.F.  22. On February 4, 2015, Patient N.F., a 35-year-old female patient, contacted Spectrum to undergo liposuction with gluteal fat transfer.  23. On April 23, 2015, prior to the procedure, Patient N.F. underwent bloodwork that revealed she had a normal hematocrit level, normal hemoglobin level, and a normal red blood cell count.  24. Also prior to her procedure, Patient N.F. indicated in her medical questionnaire that she was pregnant at least twice.  25. Because Patient N.F. disclosed her prior pregnancies to Respondent, Respondent knew, or should have known, that Patient N.F. had a potentially weak or thin abdominal wall.  26. Respondent determined that Patient N.F. was of good health and an appropriate candidate to undergo liposuction.  27. Respondent performed liposuction with gluteal fat transfer on Patient N.F. at Spectrum on May 15, 2015.  28. Following the surgery, Patient N.F. experienced abdominal pain, weakness, and an inability to walk, resulting in her admission to Baptist Hospital.  29. During an exploratory surgery, Patient N.F. was found to have a hole in her small bowel (colon), which was leaking  fluid into her abdominal cavity.’ Facts Related to Patient P.N.  30. On May 16, 2015, Patient P.N., a 35-year-old female patient, was scheduled to undergo liposuction with gluteal fat transfer at Encore.  31. On May 4, 2015, prior to her procedure, Patient P.N. underwent bloodwork that revealed she had a normal hematocrit level, normal hemoglobin level, and a normal red blood cell count.  32. Respondent determined that Patient P.N. was of sufficiently good health and an appropriate candidate to undergo liposuction.  33. Respondent performed liposuction with gluteal fat transfer on Patient P.N. as scheduled.  34. Following the surgery, Patient P.N. experienced extreme pain and heavy bleeding, resulting in her admission to Memorial Regional Hospital.  35. Upon admission, Patient P.N.'s hematology report revealed a low hematocrit level, and low hemoglobin, which signified severely diminished blood levels and necessitated a blood transfusion.  Facts Related to Concentration of Tumescent Solution  36. Before harvesting Patients L.L.'s, D.M.'s, N.F.'s, and P.N.'s fat, Respondent infiltrated tumescent solution into the  areas that were prepared to undergo liposuction. 37. Tumescent solution is a mixture of natural saline, epinephrine, and lidocaine and is used to decrease the risk of excesSive bleeding caused by large-volume liposuction procedures.  38. Epinephrine, the active ingredient in tumescent solution, constricts blood vessels and reduces blood loss.  39. The minimum concentration of epinephrine in tumescent solution needed to achieve its intended purpose of reducing blood loss is 1:1,000,000.  40. This concentration was first popularized by Dr. Jeffrey Klein in 1965. After experimenting with several concentrations of epinephrine, Dr. Klein concluded that a 1:1,000,000 concentration of epinephrine appropriately balanced patient safety with effectiveness. The most dilute concentration of epinephrine Dr. Klein experimented with was 1:2,000,000.  41. Dr. Klein's concentration of epinephrine in tumescent solution of 1:1,000,000 is the standard concentration in the state of Florida for BBL procedures.  42. The medical records reflect that during each of the four procedures, Respondent used tumescent solution with an epinephrine concentration of 1:4,000,000. This concentration is too diluted to have the intended effect of restricting blood loss.  43. However, the tumescent solution was prepared by the  circulators who assisted during the surgeries. The circulators credibly testified that when preparing the tumescent solution, they used enough epinephrine to create at least a 1:1,000,000 concentration of epinephrine. The circulators prepared the tumescent solution by adding lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine and one cubic centimeter (cc) of epinephrine to a one-liter (1000 cc) bag of normal saline.  44, The circulators explained that the additional epinephrine that was used was not documented in the patients' operating room records because there was no designated space on the form for this information.  45. In light of the circulators' credible testimony, no evidence was presented to support the conclusion that Respondent fell below the standard of care by using an inappropriate concentration of epinephrine in the tumescent solution. Further, there was no causal connection demonstrated between the patients’ blood loss, a fairly common complication associated with BBL procedures, and the concentration of epinephrine used.  Facts Related to Damage to Internal Organs  46. During Patient N.F.'s liposuction procedure, Respondent used a cannula to remove 4,000 ccs of supernatant fat from Patient N.F.'s abdomen, waist, back, bra rolls, and flanks.  47. While manipulating the cannula, Respondent pushed the cannula through Patient N.F.'s abdominal wall and punctured her  small bowel.  10  48. Because Respondent perforated Patient N.F.'s small bowel, Patient N.F.'s abdominal cavity was contaminated, and 10 to 15 centimeters of Patient N.F.'s bowel later had to be resected and removed.  49. After Patient N.F.'s hospitalization, her mother confronted Respondent who admitted that he ""messed up,"" and suggested that his instrument ""cuts through muscle and fat like butter,"" and may have contributed to the perforation.  50. During Patient D.M.'s liposuction procedure, Respondent used a cannula to remove 4,000 ccs of Supernatant fat from Patient D.M.'s abdomen, waist, back, bra rolls, and flanks.  51. While manipulating the cannula, Respondent pushed the cannula through Patient D.M.'s abdominal wall, damaging her chest wall, and Respondent punctured her liver at least five times.  52. Respondent was responsible for ensuring that the cannula used during liposuction procedures was manipulated with precision and extreme care to avoid contact with the patients' internal organs.  53. In order for the cannula to come into contact with an internal organ (with the exception of the heart and lungs), Respondent pushed the cannula at an inappropriate angle through a thick layer of muscle called the abdominal wall. The tough abdominal wall has a noticeably different consistency than the  soft layers of subcutaneous fat. A surgeon is required to  11 operate with a level of skill and care to be able to discern between subcutaneous fat and muscle tissue while passing the cannula through the patient.  54. The standard of care in Florida requires surgeons to use extreme care to ensure that the abdominal wall is not breeched. This is especially true when the patient's medical history suggests the possibility of a thin abdominal wall.  55. According to both Petitioner's and Respondent's experts the perforation of an internal organ during a liposuction procedure, even once, is an extremely rare incident.  56. In fact, Respondent's world-renowned BBL expert,  Dr. Mendieta explained, ""I'm constantly thinking bowel, bowel, bowel perforation or I'm constantly thinking trying to avoid, so it is constantly on my mind in terms of what I am trying to avoid, so I'm always angling my cannula and making sure that I'm on the right plane.""”/  57. Dr. Mendieta admitted that although perforating an internal organ is a ""known complication"" related to liposuction, it can result from medical negligence.  58. Respondent argues he is absolved of any responsibility for the puncture of internal organs because Patients D.M. and N.F. signed consent forms that included the risk of ""damage to deeper structures, including nerves, blood vessels, muscles, and  lungs.""  12 parties. At the December 7, 2016, deposition, Dr. Greenberg was asked again about the meaning of the language in an identical informed consent form. His answer at the December 7, 2016 deposition was in complete and direct conflict with the answer he gave regarding identical informed consent language during the October 24-25, 2016 DOAH hearing.  3) On December 8, 2016, the Department filed its Proposed Recommended Order asking the judge to make a finding of fact based on the hearing testimony of Dr. Greenberg. Although clearly pertinent, and potentially exculpatory to this case, the Petitioner did not disclose to the Administrative Law Judge that this expert had changed his opinion during the December 7 deposition, which appears to be required under Florida Ethics Rules 4-3.3 and 4-3.8, which require candor before a tribunal and for a lawyer to take reasonable remedial measures if he knows that he has offered material evidence and learns of its falsity.  4) The Administrative Law Judge issued a Recommended Order in this case on January 6, 2017. In her Recommended Order, the Judge made a finding that the language in the consent forms does not include the injuries sustained by the patients, as proposed by the Department, based  solely on the testimony of Dr. Greenberg, 59. Significantly, the informed consent forms for liposuction signed by the patients did not include damage to the liver, small bowel, or other intra-abdominal organs.  60. Petitioner's expert, Dr. Greenberg, explained that the language in the consent form does not contemplate damage to internal organs shielded by the abdominal wall, and a lay person would be unlikely to make such an inference.  61. Dr. Greenberg credibly testified that it is a violation of the standard of care to damage a patient's internal organs during a liposuction procedure, regardless of whether it is a known complication.  62. Dr. Mendieta countered that the only way for a surgeon to violate the standard of care would be to either intentionally Stab the patient, or to perform the surgery in such a reckless and careless manner, improperly angling the cannula, that damage to the surrounding structures is either inevitable or purposeful.  63. As noted by all three experts, absent being present during the procedure, having it well-documented in the Respondent's notes, or talking with Respondent, it is not possible to tell with certainty what transpired. Respondent refused to testify on his own behalf. Respondent asserted his Fifth Amendment Privilege against self-incrimination, instead of  clarifying any of the disputed issues.  13  64. Based on the forgoing, Petitioner demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that the puncture of the patients' internal organs was the result of Respondent's violation of the standard of care and improper angling of the cannula during the procedures.  Facts Related to the Alleged Medical Records Violation  65. The circulators at Vanity, Encore, and Spectrum Aesthetics testified that they prepared the tumescent solution that Respondent used during his liposuction procedures at Respondent's direction.  66. The circulators testified that when preparing the tumescent solution, they used enough epinephrine to create at least a 1:1,000,000 concentration of epinephrine. However, the additional epinephrine that was purportedly used was never documented in the patients' operating room records.  67. Respondent argues that it was the responsibility of the circulators who prepared the solutions or the facilities at which he operated that maintain the records, which bear responsibility for the accuracy of the records.  68. Respondent is the surgeon who performed the surgery on each patient. The operative records for each surgery bear the Same Signature in every signature block for ""Surgeon Signature,""  ""Physician Signature,” ""Osakatukei O. Omulepu, M.D.,"" and ""Osak  14 Omulepu, MD."" In most instances, the signature is clearly legible as 0.0. Omulepu.  69. The record supports by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent signed or approved these records and bears responsibility for their accuracy. However, Respondent reviewed and signed the medical records, all of which omitted the additional ampule of epinephrine that was purportedly added, without correcting the apparent discrepancy.  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  70. The Division of Administrative Hearings has personal and subject matter jurisdiction in this proceeding pursuant to sections 120.569 and 120.57(1), Florida Statutes (2016).  71. A proceeding to suspend, revoke, or impose other discipline upon a license is penal in nature. State ex rel. Vining v. Fla. Real Estate Comm'n, 281 So. 2d 487, 491 (Fla. 1973). Petitioner must therefore prove the charges against Respondent by clear and convincing evidence. Fox v. Dep't of Health, 994 So. 2d 416, 418 (Fla. lst DCA 2008) (citing Dep't of  Banking & Fin. v. Osborne Stern & Co., 670 So. 2d 932 (Fla.  1996)). 72. ‘The clear and convincing standard of proof has been described by the Florida Supreme Court: Clear and convincing evidence requires that  the evidence must be found to be credible; the facts to which the witnesses testify must  15 be distinctly remembered; the testimony must  be precise and explicit and the witnesses  must be lacking in confusion as to the facts  in issue. The evidence must be of such  weight that it produces in the mind of the  trier of fact a firm belief or conviction,  without hesitancy, as to the truth of the  allegations sought to be established. In re Davey, 645 So. 2d 398, 404 (Fla. 1994) (quoting Slomowitz v. Walker, 429 So. 2d 797, 800 (Fla. 4th DCA 1983)).  73. Disciplinary statutes and rules ""must always be construed strictly in favor of the one against whom the penalty would be imposed and are never to be extended by construction."" Griffis v. Fish & Wildlife Conserv. Comm'n, 57 So. 3d 929, 931 (Fla. lst DCA 2011); Munch v. Dep't of Prof'l Reg., Div. of Real Estate, 592 So. 2d 1136 (Fla. Ist DCA 1992).  74. The grounds proving Petitioner's assertion that Respondent's license should be disciplined must be those specifically alleged in the Second Amended Administrative Complaint. See e.g., Trevisani v. Dep't of Health, 908 So. 2d 1108 (Fla. Ist DCA 2005); Kinney v. Dep't of State, 501 So. 2d 129 (Fla. 5th DCA 1987); and Hunter v. Dep't of Prof'l Reg., 458  So. 2d 842 (Fla. 2d DCA 1984).  Counts I through IV -— Standard of Care Violations  75. Section 458.331(1) (t), Florida Statutes, provides that it is a violation for a medical doctor to commit medical  malpractice, as defined in section 456.50, Florida Statutes. The  16 statute goes on to state that ""the Board shall give great weight to the provisions of s. 766.102 when enforcing this paragraph.""  76. Section 456.50(1)(g) defines ""medical malpractice” as the failure to practice medicine in accordance with the level of care, skill, and treatment recognized in general law related to health care licensure.  77. The ""level of care, skill, and treatment recognized in general law related to health care licensure"" means the standard of care specified in section 766.102, Florida Statutes.  78. Subsections (1), (2), and (3) (b) of section 766.102 state (in relevant part):  (1) In any action for recovery of damages based on the death or personal injury of any person in which it is alleged that such death or injury resulted from the negligence of a health care provider as defined in  s. 766.202(4), the claimant shall have the burden of proving by the greater weight of evidence that the alleged actions of the health care provider represented a breach of the prevailing professional standard of care for that health care provider. The prevailing professional standard of care for a given health care provider shall be that level of care, skill, and treatment which, in light of all relevant surrounding circumstances, iS recognized as acceptable and appropriate by reasonably prudent similar health care providers.  (2) (a) If the injury is claimed to have resulted from the negligent affirmative medical intervention of the health care provider, the claimant must, in order to prove a breach of the prevailing professional standard of care, show that the injury was  1? not within the necessary or reasonably foreseeable results of the surgical, medicinal, or diagnostic procedure constituting the medical intervention, if the intervention from which the injury is alleged to have resulted was carried out in accordance with the prevailing professional standard of care by a reasonably prudent Similar health care provider.  (b) The provisions of this subsection shall apply only when the medical intervention was undertaken with the informed consent of the patient in compliance with the provisions of Ss. 766.103.  (3) (b) The existence of a medical injury  does not create any inference or presumption of negligence against a health care provider, and the claimant must maintain the burden of proving that an injury was proximately caused by a breach of the prevailing professional standard of care by the health care provider.  79. The Second Amended Administrative Complaint alleges the following violations of the standard of care:  1. Failing to use the proper concentration of epinephrine in the tumescent solution used  during surgery. (D.M., N.F., L.L. and P.N.)  2. Failing to inject the proper amount of fatty tissue. (D.M.)  3. Injecting fat into the sciatic nerve. (N.F.)  4. Puncturing or perforating internal organs. (D.M. and N.F.)  80. For all four patients, the Second Amended Administrative Complaint alleges Respondent used tumescent solution with a  concentration of one part per 4 million units. At the hearing,  18 evidence and testimony was provided from all of the circulators involved in these cases. The evidence and testimony was clear that the tumescent solution used by Respondent was always prepared the same way--one cc of epinephrine was added to each liter of saline, creating a tumescent solution with a concentration of at least one part per million of epinephrine. This is the concentration Petitioner alleges should have been used, and Respondent did not fall below the standard of care with respect to the amount of tumescent solution used in these procedures.  81. The Second Amended Administrative Complaint alleges that Respondent injected 1250 ccs of fat into Patient D.M.'s buttocks bilaterally, and that the standard amount of fatty tissue injected is approximately 500 ccs. No evidence was presented to support this allegation. To the contrary, the evidence in this case establishes that it is within the standard of care for surgeons who routinely do this procedure to inject 1500 ccs or more of fat into each side of the buttocks. The Respondent did not fall below the standard of care by injecting 1250 ccs of fat into Patient D.M.  82. The Second Amended Administrative Complaint states that the Respondent injected fatty tissue into Patient N.F.'s sciatic nerve, and that this was below the standard of care. The evidence  did not establish that fatty tissue was injected into the  19 patient's sciatic nerve, and thus there is no evidence to support this allegation.  83. Finally, the Second Amended Administrative Complaint alleges that Respondent fell below the standard of care by puncturing or perforating internal organs (Patients D.M. and N.F.). Respondent asserts that these minimal allegations are insufficient to put him on notice of the nature of the alleged violation. Respondent correctly points out that nothing in the administrative complaint specifically alleges that Respondent improperly angled the cannula.  84. However, the allegations certainly put the Respondent on notice that his admitted multiple punctures to internal organs in  these two patients was a basis upon which the Petitioner sought to  discipline his license. Respondent could have used interrogatories or the deposition of the Petitioner's expert to discern detailed ultimate facts regarding how Petitioner believed the negligence to have occurred.  85. The clear and convincing testimony of the experts was that organ punctures during liposuction are exceedingly rare complications which do not occur in the absence of recklessness in the placement of the cannula, and insufficient attention to the feel of the procedure itself as the cannula passes through fat,  tissues, muscles and the abdominal wall.  20 86. An organ puncture during liposuction is not a per se act of medical negligence. Nevertheless, in this case, Respondent admitted to Patient N.F's mother that he ""messed up"" and sliced through Patient N.F.'s small bowel with his cannula like it was ""butter."" This exceedingly rare complication occurred in not one, but two, of Respondent's procedures, on the same day.  87. Respondent's assertion of his Fifth Amendment Privilege against self-incrimination permits the fact-finder to draw  adverse inferences from his silence. Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425  U.S. 308 (1976).  88. The only inference that can be drawn is that Respondent violated the standard of care and committed malpractice by the reckless and improper angling of the cannula for these two procedures, resulting in the perforation of internal organs.  89. Petitioner proved by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated section 458.331(1) (t) by puncturing Patient  D.M.'s liver multiple times and Patient N.F.'s small bowel.  Count V - Repeated Medical Malpractice  90. As discussed herein, Petitioner failed to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent committed repeated medical malpractice by committing three or more incidents of medical malpractice on Patients D.M., N.F., L.L.,  and/or P.N. Accordingly, Respondent did not violate  21  section 458.331(1) (t), Florida Statutes (2014), by committing repeated medical malpractice.  Counts VI-IX -—- Medical Records Violations  91. Section 458.331(1) (m) provides that it is a violation for a physician to fail to keep legible, as defined by Department rule in consultation with the Board, medical records that identify the licensed physician or the physician extender and supervising physician by name and professional title, who is or are responsible for rendering, ordering, supervising, or billing for each diagnostic or treatment procedure and that justify the course of treatment of the patient, including, but not limited to, patient histories; examination results; test results; records of drugs prescribed, dispensed, or administered; and reports of consultations and hospitalizations.  92. Petitioner proved by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent failed to create or keep medical records that accurately reflected the amount of epinephrine administered to Patients L.L., D.M., N.F., and P.N.  93. As a result, Petitioner proved by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated section 458.331(1) (m).  Penalty Assessment  94. Respondent has no prior discipline against his medical  license.  22  5) Respondent filed an exception to this finding, and contacted Petitioner to see if it would agree not to contest this exception based on the subsequent testimony of its expert.  6) Petitioner did not respond to counsel for Respondent, but filed responses to Respondent’s exceptions on February 13, contesting the exception despite the change in its expert’s opinion about the meaning of the informed consent form.  7) _ This information represents a substantial change in the evidence in this case, which was not known on the date of the hearing, and which may materially affect the fact-finding of the Administrative Law Judge in this case, including the finding of the existence of the standard of care violations.  8) Although Rule 1.540(b) of the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure does not govern procedure in cases pending under Chapter 120, Florida Statutes, it is nevertheless useful to look to the language of that rule for guidance when trying to address a situation like the one presented by this motion in which a party to a disciplinary proceeding faces the possibility of being denied fundamental fair play and basic due process. In pertinent part,  Rule 1.540(b) offers the following types of relief: | 95. Petitioner imposes penalties upon licensees consistent with disciplinary guidelines prescribed by rule. See Parrot  Heads, Inc. v. Dep't of Bus. & Prof'l Reg., 741 So. 2d 1231,  1233-34 (Fla. 5th DCA 1999). 96. Penalties in a licensure discipline case may not exceed those in effect at the time the violations were committed.  Willner v. Dep't of Prof'l Reg., Bd. of Med., 563 So. 2d 805, 806  (Fla. lst DCA 1990), rev. denied, 576 So. 2d 295 (Fla. 1991). Id.  97. At the time of the incidents, Florida Administrative Code Rule 64B8-8.001(2) (t) provided that for a first-time offender committing medical malpractice, as described in section 458.331(1) (t), the prescribed penalty range was from one year probation to revocation or denial and an administrative fine from $1,000.00 to $10,000.00. The recommended penalty for a second violation of section 458.331(1) (t) ranged from two years of probation to revocation and an administrative fine from $5,000.00 to $10,000.00.  98. Rule 64B8-8.001(2) (m) provided that for a first-time offender failing to keep required medical records, as described in section 458.331(1) (m), the prescribed penalty range was from a reprimand to denial or two (2) years of suspension followed by  probation, and an administrative fine from $1,000.00 to  $10,000.00. The recommended penalty for a second violation of  23  section 458.331(1) (m) ranged from probation to suspension followed by probation or denial and an administrative fine from $5,000.00 to $10,000.00.  99. Rule 64B8-8.001(3) provided that, in applying the penalty guidelines, the following aggravating and mitigating circumstances should also be taken into account:  (3) Aggravating and Mitigating Circumstances. Based upon consideration of aggravating and mitigating factors present in an individual case, the Board may deviate from the penalties recommended above. The Board shall consider as aggravating or mitigating factors the following:  (a) Exposure of patient or public to injury or potential injury, physical or otherwise: none, slight, severe, or death;  (ob) Legal status at the time of the offense: no restraints, or legal constraints;  (c) The number of counts or separate offenses established;  (d) The number of times the same offense or offenses have previously been committed by the licensee or applicant;  (e) The disciplinary history of the applicant or licensee in any jurisdiction and the length of practice;  (f) Pecuniary benefit or self~gain inuring to the applicant or licensee;  (g) The involvement in any violation of Section 458.331, F.S., of the provision of controlled substances for trade, barter or sale, by a licensee. In such cases, the Board will deviate from the penalties  24 recommended above and impose suspension or revocation of licensure.  (h) Where a licensee has been charged with violating the standard of care pursuant to Section 458.331(1) (t), F-.S., but the licensee, who is also the records owner pursuant to Section 456.057(1), F.S., fails to keep and/or produce the medical records. (i) Any other relevant mitigating factors.  100. A significant aggravating factor is that Respondent's actions exposed Patients D.M. and N.F. to severe injury or death.*/ Aggravating factor (c) applies because Petitioner established six separate offenses committed by Respondent. Additionally, under paragraph (h), Respondent was charged with violating the standard of care and it was found that he failed to keep adequate medical records. This is mitigated by Petitioner's prior nine years of discipline-free history.  RECOMMENDATION  Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, it is RECOMMENDED that the Board of Medicine enter a final order finding that Respondent violated sections 458.331(1) (t) and 458.331(1) (m), Florida Statutes, as charged in Petitioner's Second Amended Administrative Complaint; imposing a fine of $14,000.00""; issuing a reprimand against Petitioner for the record-keeping violations; placing Respondent on probation for a  period of two years; and imposing costs of the investigation and  prosecution of this case.  25  DONE AND ENTERED this 6th day of January, 2017, in  MARY LI CREASY  Administrative Law Judge  Division of Administrative Hearings The DeSoto Building  1230 Apalachee Parkway  Tallahassee, Florida 32399-3060 (850) 488-9675  Fax Filing (850) 921-6847 www.doah.state.fl.us  Tallahassee, Leon County, Florida.  Filed with the Clerk of the Division of Administrative Hearings this 6th day of January, 2017.  ENDNOTES l/ Petitioner's tendered expert, Dr. Scott Greenberg, was qualified to provide an opinion with regard to liposuction. However, the undersigned found that Dr. Greenberg was not an expert on the gluteal fat transfer procedure portion of the BBL. It is this portion of the procedure during which Petitioner alleges Respondent injured Patient N.F.'s sciatic nerve. Accordingly, Dr. Greenberg was prohibited from offering testimony on the gluteal fat transfer and there was no evidence presented upon which to make findings of fact regarding Patient N.F.'s nerve damage. Petitioner made a proffer of this testimony for the record. 2/ Respondent's Ex. 1, Deposition transcript of Dr. Mendieta 47/15-20. 3/ Respondent's suggestion, that Patient D.M.'s liver puncture and injury to her abdomen and chest wall were minor because there was no treatment provided, is rejected. D.M. endured significant pain. Just because repair was not possible does not render the injury less than serious. ‘/ The penalty includes $5,000.00 each ($10,000.00 total) for the malpractice committed against Patients D.M. and N.F., plus  26  $1,000.00 each for the four record-keeping violations. Although the recommended penalty for the second through fourth record- keeping violations range from $5,000.00 to $10,000.00, the undersigned does not believe assessing the higher penalty serves a deterrent effect because these four violations all occurred within a 48-hour period. Additionally, it should be noted that the Second Amended Complaint, which included the record-keeping counts for the first time, was not filed until the morning of the Final hearing.

OMULEPU, M.D., 18000, 2015-19442, 2015-20428 RESPONDENT, ee  PETITONER’S RESPONSE TO RESPONDENT'S EXCEPTIONS TO RECOMMENDED ORDER  The State of Florida, Department of Health (Petitioner), by and through its undersigned attorney and pursuant to section 120.57, Florida Statutes (2016), and Rule 28-106.217, Florida Administrative Code, hereby files the following Response to Respondent's Exceptions to the Recommended Order (RO) filed January 6, 2017, in the above-styled cause.  Petitioner’s General Response  The Board of Medicine is vested by the laws of Florida with the authority to interpret and apply such laws, regulations, and policies as are applicable to programs within the Board's regulatory sphere. The Board may reject or modify an Administrative Law Judge’s (ALJ) Recommended Order as provided in section 120.57(1)(/), Florida Statutes (2016), which provides:  The agency may adopt the recommended order as the final order of the  agency. The agency in its final order may reject or modify the conclusions  of law over which it has substantive jurisdiction and interpretation of  administrative rules over which it has substantive jurisdiction. When rejecting or modifying such conctusion of law or interpretation of administrative rule,  1 the agency must state with particularity its reasons for rejecting or modifying such conclusion of law or interpretation of administrative rule and must make a_finding that its substituted conclusion of law or interpretation of administrative rule is as or more reasonable than that which was rejected or modified. Rejection or modification of conclusions of law may not form the basis for rejection or modification of findings of fact. The agency may not reject or modify the findings of fact unless the agency first determines from a review of the entire record, and states with particularity in the order, that the findings of fact were not based upon competent substantial evidence or that the proceedings on which the findings were based did not comply with the essential requirements of law. The agency may accept the recommended penalty in a recommended order, but may not reduce or increase it without a_ review of the complete record and without stating with particularity its reasons therefor in the order, by citing to the record in justifying the action.  (emphasis added).  According to section 120.57(1)(I), the Board may reject or modify the findings of fact if the Board first determines from a review of the entire record, and states with particularity in the order, that the findings of fact were not based upon competent substantial evidence or that the proceedings on which the findings were based did not comply with essential requirements of law. The Board is “not authorized to weigh the evidence presented, judge credibility of witnesses, or otherwise interpret the evidence to fit its desired ultimate conclusion.” Heifetz v. Dep't of Bus. Regulation, 475 So. 2d 1277,  1281-82 (Fla. ist DCA 1985); see also Rogers v. Dep't of Health, 920 So. 2d 27, 31 (Fla.  ist DCA 2005). “An ALJ's findings cannot be rejected unless there is no competent, substantial evidence from which the findings could reasonably be inferred.” Prysi v. Dep't  of Health, 823 So. 2d 823, 825 (Fla. ist DCA 2002).  In its review of the record, the Board is not permitted to resolve conflicts, judge the credibility of witnesses, or draw inferences from the evidence. These actions are at the  sole discretion of the Administrative Law Judge. Similarly, the Board may not reevaluate  2 the quantity or quality of the evidence presented at the final hearing. The only evaluation that the Board is authorized to make is whether the evidence is competent and substantial. See Martuccio v. Dep't of Prof'l Regulation, Bd. of Optometry, 622 So. 2d 607, 609 (Fla. 1st  DCA 1993), citing Heifetz, 475 So. 2d 1277; Brogan v. Carter, 671 So. 2d 822, 823 (Fla.  1st DCA 1996).  Competent substantial evidence was defined by the Florida Supreme Court in the  following way:  Substantial evidence has been described as such evidence as will establish a  substantial basis of fact from which the fact at issue can be reasonably  inferred. We have stated it to be such relevant evidence as a reasonable  mind would accept as adequate to support a conclusion..:. We are of the  __ view, however, that the evidence relied upon to sustain the ultimate finding  should be sufficiently relevant and material that a2 reasonable mind would  - accept it as adequate to support the conclusion reached. To this extent the ‘substantial’ evidence should also be ‘competent.’  DeGroot v. Sheffield, 95 So. 2d 912, 916 (Fla. 1957)(emphasis added, internal citations omitted).  Therefore, “[i]f the administrative law judge’s findings are supported by competent substantial evidence, the agency cannot reject them even to make alternate findings that are also supported by competent substantial evidence.” Resnick v. Flagler Cty. Sch. Bd., 46 So. 3d 1110, 1112-13 (Fla. 5th DCA 2010)(citing Gross v. Dep't of Health, 819 So. 2d 997, 1002 (Fla. Sth DCA 2002)). “An agency abuses its discretion when it improperly  rejects an administrative law judge's findings.” Resnick 46 So. 3d at 1113.  However, when findings of fact become matters of opinion and such opinions include policy considerations over which the Board has special responsibility, the Board is permitted  to reject or modify them notwithstanding the fact that they are called findings of fact. Sch.  3 Bd. of Leon Cty. v. Hargis, 400 So. 2d 103 (Fla. App. 1981). Therefore, the standard to be applied by the Board when deciding the validity of exceptions to findings of fact includes 1) whether the record, taken as a whole, establishes a basis of fact from which the facts at issue can be reasonably inferred; 2) whether the evidence relied on to sustain the facts is sufficiently relevant and material that a reasonable mind would accept it as supporting the conclusion reached; and 3) whether the Board has spedal reasonability in these matters such that it has special insight which must be considered.  However, if a finding of fact in a RO is improperly labeled by an ALJ, the label should be disregarded and the item treated as though it were properly labeled as a conclusion of law. Battaglia Props. v. Fla. Land & Adjudicatory Comm'n, 629 So. 2d 161, 168 (Fla. 5th DCA 1994). Issues determined by ordinary methods of proof including the weighing of evidence and judging credibility are findings of fact, while issues resolvable only by policy determination are conclusions of law. Holmes v. Turlington, 480 So. 2d 150 (Fla. ist DCA 1985).  In order to reject or modify a conclusion of law, the Board must: a) state with particularity its reasons for rejecting or modifying such conclusions of law; and b) make a finding that the substituted conclusion of law is as or more reasonable than that which was rejected or modified. Id. See also Barfield v. Dep’t of Health, 805 So. 2d 1008 (Fla. 1st DCA 2001); Pan Am World Airways v. Fla. Pub. Serv. Comm’n, 427 So. 2d 716 (Fla. 1983); Humana, Inc, v. Dep’t of HRS, 492 So. 2d 388, 392 (Fila 4th DCA 1987); Bayonet Point  Regional Medical Center v. Dep’t of HRS, 516 So. 2d 995 (Fla. 1st DCA 1987). An agency may adopt the ALJ's findings of fact and conclusions of law, and reduce or increase the recommended penalty of the ALJ in its Final Order. Crim. Just, Stds. & Training Comm'n v. Bradley, 596 So. 2d 661, 663 (Fla. 1992).  [I}t is a primary function of professional disciplinary boards to determine the  appropriate punishment of the misconduct of the professionals it regulates.  As long as the statute under which a professional agency operates provides  guidelines for imposing penalties, the agency complies with section  120.57(1)[()], and the increased penalty falls within the guidelines  established by its statute, a professional board or agency has the discretion  to increase the recommended penalty.  Id. Based on the foregoing requirements of law and argument below, Petitioner requests that the Board of Medicine (Board) deny Respondent’s Exceptions to the Recommended Order.  Petitioner’s General Response to the Sufficiency of the Administrative Complaint  In order to impose discipline against a licensee, section 120.60(5), Florida Statutes, requires an agency to serve the licensee with an administrative complaint which affords reasonable notice of the facts or conduct which warrant the intended action.  Petitioner was charged in the Second Amended Administrative Complaint (AC) with medical malpractice under section 458.331(1)(t), Florida Statutes. As referenced in paragraph 31 of the AC, section 456.50(1)(g), Florida Statutes, defines medical malpractice as the failure to practice medicine in accordance with the level of care, skill, and treatment recognized in general Jaw related to health care licensure. The AC further states, in  paragraphs 34 and 38, that Respondent fell below the standard of care when he repeatedly  punctured Patient D.M.’s liver and Patient N.F.’s smail bowel. The AC provided Respondent  with reasonable notice of the allegation that his treatment of the respective patients, specifically related to his puncturing of Patient D.M.’s liver and Patient N.F.’s small bowel, was below the standard of care.  The AC also provided Respondent with reasonable notice of violations alleged under section 458.331(1)(m), Florida Statutes. Paragraphs 10, 18, 25, and 30 of the AC State that the Respondent documented using a tumescent solution with a concentration of one part epinephrine per 4 million units for each patient’s procedure. Paragraphs 56, 62, 68, and 74 state that Respondent failed to accurately document the epinephrine  concentration used in each patient’s procedure.  ~~-~=Some conflict in the facts alleged in the charging document are inevitable when ~ Petitioner charges alternative violations. Petitioner argued that Respondent’s records were the best evidence of what epinephrine concentration was uSed during the procedures and recommended the ALJ find that Respondent practiced below the standard of care by using a concentration of one part epinephrine per 4 million units. The ALJ determined, based on evidence offered by the Respondent, that he actually used a  concentration of at least one part epinephrine per 4 million units.  The amount of epinephrine used by Respondent was a fact at issue in the hearing. The AC provided reasonable notice to Respondent that Petitioner intended to pursue discipline under section 458.331(1)(m), Florida Statutes, should the factual findings  deviate from what was documented in his records. General Response to Complaints that Certain Facts were not Alleged in  the Administrative Complaint  . The Department's governing statutes do not require the inclusion of every piece of evidence that may be introduced during a disciplinary proceeding in an administrative complaint. As Respondent admits, there is no law that requires the Department include every piece of evidence it seeks to introduce in the administrative complaint. As such, it was not a violation of the Respondent's due process rights for this evidence to be  considered by the ALJ.  Section 120.569(2)(g), Florida Statutes, provides “Irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded, but all other evidence of a type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs shall be admissible. . -"" Here, the ALJ found that the evidence introduced into the record was relevant, material, and not unduly prejudicial. The Board has no authority to remove individual findings of fact from the RO on the grounds that they were not explicitly stated on the face of the  AC.  General Response to References to section 766.102  Section 458.331(1)(t), Florida Statutes, only requires the Board give great weight to  section 766.102, Florida Statutes, in enforcement actions. It is not binding, per se.  Section 766.102(2)(a), Florida Statutes, requires a malpractice claimant to prove an | injury is not a necessary or reasonably foreseeable outcome of a procedure, had the  procedure been carried out within the standard of care. The fact that a negative outcome to a surgical procedure is known to have occurred does not make it necessary or reasonably foreseeable. While Respondent's experts label organ punctures as “known complications,” the record is devoid of any evidence that these physicians believe organ puncture is a reasonably foreseeable outcome of a routine liposuction procedure. The ALJ considered this defense and rejected it as a matter of fact in paragraphs 46 through 61 of the RO.  These findings are supported by competent, substantial evidence and should not be  disturbed.  Section 766.102(3)(b), provides that the existence of an injury does not create an  inference or presumption of negligence against a healthcare provider. It does not prevent  ~the ALJ fronrgiving injury evidence great weight and using it in conjunction with other  direct or circumstantial evidence to find a practitioner fell below the standard of care.  Response to Exception No. 1: Paragraphs 16 and 25. Paragraphs 16 and 25 of the RO state:  16. Because Patient D.M. disclosed her prior pregnancies to Respondent, Respondent Knew, or should have known, that Patient D.M. had a potentially weak or thin abdominal wall.  25. Because Patient N.F. disclosed her prior pregnancies to Respondent, Respondent knew, or should have known, that Patient N.F. had a potentially weak or thin abdominal wall.  Petitioner realleges and incorporates its General Response to the Sufficiency of the  AC and General Response to Complaint that Certain Facts were not Alleged in the AC.  The remainder of Respondent's argument in this exception requests that the Board re-weigh the evidence and place greater weight on Respondent's “intended purpose” than  the finding of the ALJ, which is impermissible. The ALJ’s finding was supported by  8  os ARREST RM erg! Bo PA oP PEE OS competent, substantial evidence, including the testimony of Respondent's expert, who admitted in cross examination that a potentially weak abdominal wall was something that the surgeon should be aware of and consider in the course of treatment. (T. Vol. 2, p. 152) The ALJ clearly found Respondent’s “intended purpose” less credible than  Petitioner’s position.  The ALJ's finding that Respondent knew or should have known Patient D.M.’s and N.F.’s potentially weak abdominal walls is based on written pre-operative records bearing Respondent's signature. (P. Exh. 9, p 19; P. Exh. 5, p. 5) Because the ALJ’s findings in paragraphs 16 and 25 are supported by competent, substantial evidence, they should not  be disturbed.  Response to Exception No. 2: Paragraphs 49 and 86 Paragraphs 49 and 86 of the RO state:  49. After Patient N.F.’s hospitalization, her mother confronted Respondent who admitted that he “messed up,” and suggested that his instrument “cuts through muscle and fat like butter,” and may have contributed to the perforation.  86. An organ puncture during liposuction is not a per se act of medical negligence. Nevertheless, in this case, Respondent admitted to Patient N.F.’s mother that he “messed up” and sliced through Patient N.F.’s small bowell with his cannula like it was “butter.” This exceedingly rare complication occurred in not one, but two, of Respondent's procedures, on the same day.!  Petitioner realleges and incorporates its General Response to Complaints that  Certain Facts were not Alleged in the AC.  ! Respondent takes exception only to the second sentence of paragraph 86.  9  Respondent argues the ALJ’s findings are not supported by clear or convincing evidence. Under Section 120.57(1)(I), the proper evidentiary standard for these exceptions is competent and substantial evidence. The ALJ’s factual findings in paragraphs 49 and 86 are supported by competent, substantial evidence and should not  be disturbed.  Witness R.D. testified that Respondent admitted that he “messed up” Patient N.F.’s procedure and that he used a tool that “cuts through muscle and fat like it’s butter.” (T. Vol. 1, p. 48-50) The ALJ permitted the testimony into evidence and relied on it in making  these findings. Witness R.D.’s testimony about her conversation with Respondent went  ~unrebutted by any other evidence. See mre ae cn  The AL1‘s findings do not mischaracterize Witness R.D.'s testimony. Nothing in the record indicates that Respondent limited his admission to R.D. to a single injury or technique. The competent, substantial evidence in the record indicates that Respondent made a general admission that his own surgical mistakes caused D.M.’s dire complications. Respondent's true intent is to have the Board re-weigh the evidence and assign less weight to D.M.’s testimony than the findings of the ALJ, which is impermissible.  Response to Exception No. 3: Paragraph 52 Paragraph 52 of the RO states:  52. Respondent was responsible for ensuring that the cannula used during liposuction procedures was manipulated with precision and extreme care to avoid contact with the patients’ internal organs.  Petitioner realleges and incorporates its General Response to the Sufficiency of the AC and General Response to Complaint that Certain Facts were not Alleged in the AC.  10  4. Respondent’s Exception 4 to Paragraph 53 of the Recommended Order is denied for the reasons set forth in the Petitioner’s Response to Respondent’s Exceptions, for the reasons stated orally by the Petitioner, and because the Board does not have the necessary substantive jurisdiction to address the Fifth Amendment self-incrimination issue and evidentiary issues raised by Respondent.  5. Respondent’s Exception 5 to Paragraph 54 of the Recommended Order is denied for the reasons set forth in the Petitioner’s Response to Respondent’s Exceptions and for the reasons stated orally by the Petitioner.  6. Respondent’s Exception 6 to Paragraph 56 of the Recommended Order is denied for the reasons set forth in the Petitioner’s Response to Respondent’s Exceptions and for the reasons stated orally by the Petitioner.  7. Respondent’s Exception 7 to Paragraph 57 of the Recommended Order is denied for the reasons set forth in the Petitioner’s Response to Respondent’s Exceptions and for the reasons stated orally by the Petitioner.  8. Respondent’s Exception 8 to Paragraph 58 of the  Recommended Order is denied for the reasons set forth in the Paragraph 52 simply states the ALJ’s finding as to the standard of care for surgeons performing liposuction near internal organs. The ALJ’s finding is supported by portions of both parties’ experts’ testimony. (T. Vol. 2, p. 165; R. Exh 1, p. 75; T. Vol. 1, p. 152-157) Because the ALJ's finding is based on competent, substantial evidence, this exception  should be denied.  Response to Exception 4: Paragraph 53 Paragraph 53 of the RO states:  53. In order for the cannula to come into contact with an internal organ (with the exception of the heart and lungs), Respondent pushed the cannula at an inappropriate angle through a thick layer of muscle called the abdominal wall. The tough abdominal wall has a noticeably different  ~~tonsistency than the soft layers of subcutaneous fat. As surgeon is required to operate with a level of skill and care to be able to discern between subcutaneous fat and muscle tissue while passing the cannula through the patient.  Petitioner realleges and incorporates its General Response to the Sufficiency of the  AC and General Response to Complaints that Certain Facts were not Alleged in the AC.  Paragraph 53 continues to explain the standard of care for surgeons performing liposuction in the abdominal region. The ALJ's finding is based on the testimony of both Petitioner’s and Respondent's experts, all of which constitutes Competent, substantial evidence. (T. Vol. 2, p. 166; T. Vol. 1, p. 154) Respondent did puncture the organs of both patients during their procedures. (T. Vol. 2, p. 162) The ALJ credited the testimony of Petitioner’s Expert, who stated that a perforation of the liver or bowel can only happen if the cannula is angled towards the patient and pushed through the abdominal wall. (T.  Vol. 1, p. 154). Respondent seeks to have the board re-weigh evidence and credit his  11  own experts’ testimony over Petitioner's. Doing so is inappropriate and this exception  should be denied.  The ALJ's finding in paragraph 63 that “...it is not possible to tell with certainty what transpired,” does not contradict the findings in paragraph 53. The clear and convincing evidence standard does not require absolute certainty. Rather, the evidence must be of such weight that it produces a firm belief or conviction in the trier of fact as to the truth of the allegations. While no expert could testify about what happened in the operating room with absolute certainty, the ALJ properly found that clear and convincing evidence supported the conclusion that the Respondent pushed the cannula at an inappropriate angle through the abdominal wall. That conclusion is supported by competent, substantial evidence, and should not be disturbed.  Response to Exception No. 5: Paragraph 54 Paragraph 54 of the RO states:  54. The standard of care in Florida requires surgeons to use extreme care to ensure that the abdominal wall is not [breached]. This is especially true when the patient’s medical history suggests the possibility of a thin abdominal wall.  Petitioner realleges and incorporates its General Response to the Sufficiency of the  AC and General Response to Complaints that Certain Facts were not Alleged in the AC.  Respondent’s expert admitted in cross examination that he employs surgical techniques designed to prevent breaching the abdominal wall in any procedure and that  the risk of breaching the abdominal wail is increased in patients whose abdominal wail is  12 potentially thin. (T. Vol. 2, p. 152-153) Therefore, competent, substantial evidence exists  to support the ALJ’s finding in paragraph 54 and it should not be disturbed.  Response to Exception No. 6: Paragraph 56  Paragraph 56 of the RO states:  56. In fact, Respondent's world-renowned BBL expert, Dr. Medieta explained, “I'm constantly thinking trying to avoid, so it is constantly on my mind in terms of what I am trying to avoid, so I’m always angling my cannula and making sure that I’m on the right plane.”  Paragraph 56 of the RO is a direct quote from one of Respondent's expert  witnesses. (R. Exh. 1, p. 47) Respondent does not dispute the accuracy of the quotation.  ~Respondent seeks to.have-the.board re-weigh the evidence and assign.greater weight to... -  one portion of the expert’s testimony than assigned by the ALJ. This is impermissible. Additionally, the portion of the testimony the Respondent wishes the ALJ afforded greater weight to merely contained the anecdotal experience of other surgeons performing liposuction procedures. This type of testimony has no bearing whatsoever on whether or not Respondent fell below the standard of care in this case. The ALJ is the fact finder charged with determining what evidence is relevant, credible, and will be incorporated  into the RO. As a result, Respondent's exception should be denied. Response to Exception No. 7: Paragraph 57 Paragraph 57 of the RO states:  57, Dr. Mendieta admitted that although perforating an internal organ is a “known complication” related to liposuction, it can result from medical negligence.  13  anette ne ats peter Bere ered greegemang en Phan gna ae The ALJ's finding is based on competent, substantial evidence and should not be disturbed. Paragraph 57 of the RO paraphrases the deposition testimony of one of Respondent's expert witnesses. (R. Exh. 1, p. 50-53) Again, Respondent does not dispute the accuracy of the statement. The ALJ is not required to use Respondent's expert testimony exclusively to support Respondent’s arguments. The expert’s testimony was entered as evidence and accurately referenced in the RO. Respondent seeks to have the Board re-weigh the evidence and assign greater weight to one portion of the expert’s testimony than assigned by the ALJ. Doing So is inappropriate, and this exception should  be denied.  Paragraph 58 of the RO states:  58. Respondent argues he is absolved of any responsibility for the puncture of internal organs because Patients D.M. and N.F. signed consent forms that included the risk of “damage to deeper structures, including nerves, blood vessels, muscles, and lungs.”  Petitioner realleges and incorporates its General Response to References to Section  766.102,  This finding is merely a recitation of the evidence in the case and not a conclusion -of Jaw. The ALJ does not mischaracterize Respondent's argument. His claim remains that a finding of malpractice (responsibility) is precluded (absolved) because any outcome referenced on the consent form is per se reasonably foreseeable. This interpretation Is  not only unsupported by the evidence, but would allow physicians to define medical  14 malpractice out of existence simply by listing all negative results of malpractice as  “known.”  The AL)’s inclusion of the language written in the consent forms for each patient iS an appropriate finding of fact and is based on competent, substantial evidence. (P. Exh.  5, p.43; P. Exh. 9, p. 44) Respondent's exception should be denied.  Response to Exception No. 9: Paragraphs 59 and 60  Paragraphs 59 and 60 of the RO state:  59. Significantly, the informed consent forms for liposuction signed by the patients did not include damage to the liver, smail bowel, or other intra- abdominal organs. , ,  60. Petitioner’s expert, Dr. Greenberg, explained that the language in the consent form does not contemplate damage to internal organs shielded by the abdominal wall, and a lay person would be unlikely to make such an inference.  The AU's findings are supported by competent, substantial evidence and should  not be disturbed. Petitioner’s expert clearly explained the rationale for his opinion:  - It doesn’t even mention bowel perforation and I think that that’s because it is not something that most plastic surgeons as we’re sitting down with the patient and they ask what are the complications that can occur during this procedure, it’s not something off the top of our heads we say that can happen. Can it happen? Yes, But I think that there clearly had to be some technical error for that -- there clearly has to be some technical error for that to occur. (T. Vol. 2, p. 75)  Additionally, the patients’ consent forms do not specifically reference any organs  shielded by the abdominal wall. (P. Exh. 5, p. 43; P. Exh. 9, p. 44) While Respondent  15  may have discussed the risks of surgery with the patients, there is no evidence in the  record as to what, if any, clarification Respondent made.  Respondent's true request seeks to have the Board re-weigh the evidence and assign greater weight to Respondent’s expert opinion on the meaning of “deeper structures” than the ALJ did. Doing so is impermissible. Because paragraph 58 is  supported by competent, substantial evidence, Respondent’s exception should be denied.  Response to Exception No. 10: Paragraphs 63, 64, 87, 88, and 89 Paragraphs 63, 64, 87, 88, and 89 state:  . .63. As. noted by all three experts, absent being present during the procedure, having it well documented in the notes, or talking with Respondent, it is not possible to tell with certainty what transpired. Respondent asserted his Fifth Amendment Privilege against self- incrimination, instead of clarifying any of the disputed issues.  64. Based on the foregoing, Petitioner demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that the puncture of the patients’ internal organs was the result of Respondent’s violation of the standard of care and improper angling of the cannula during the procedures.  87. Respondent's assertion of his Fifth Amendment Privilege against self- incrimination permits the fact-finder to draw adverse inferences from his silence. Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425 U.S. 308 (1976).  88. Theonly inference that can be drawn is that Respondent violated the standard of care and committed malpractice by the reckless and improper angling of the cannula for these two procedures, resulting in the perforation of internal organs.  89. Petitioner proved by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated section 458.331(1)(t)}) by puncturing Patient D.M.’s liver multiple times and Patient N.F.’s small bowel.  Petitioner incorporates by reference its General Response to the Sufficiency of the  AC and References to Section 766.102.  16  The Respondent first argues that it was inappropriate for the ALJ to make any findings of fact that Respondent should have performed the surgery in a certain way or that he performed the surgery in a certain way because there were no facts in the AC to support these contentions. These arguments are without merit. The Respondent cites to Trevisani v. Department of Health to support her contention that there was no competent substantial evidence to support the ALJ's findings. 908 So. 2d 1108 (2005).  However, this case is factually distinguishable from Trevisani. In Trevisani, the AL) found  that the cause of the patient’s injury was unknown and therefore it was impossible to determine if they resulted from an act or omission of the Respondent. Here, the ALJ rejected Respondent's contention that it is impossible to determine if any deviation from the standard of care contributed to the patients’ injuries, finding that the testimony of Petitioner's expert in paragraph 85 established that fact. In particular contrast with Trevisani, where the cause of injury to the patient could not be determined, it is undisputed in this case that Respondent punctured Patient N.F.’s and Patient D.M.’s  organs with his cannula.  The Respondent next argues that the ALJ departed from the essential requirements of law by drawing negative inferences from Respondent's silence. Respondent relies on Vining v. Florida Real Estate Commission for this argument. In Vininig, a statute required a person licensed by the real estate commission to file a sworn answer to any complaint served upon him by that commission. 281 So. 2d 487 (Fla. 1973). The Florida Supreme Court held that such a statute was unconstitutional because  it violated a person’s right against self-incrimination. Id. at 491. The Court based its  17 holding on its finding that administrative proceedings that may result in deprivation of livelihood are penal in nature, and as such, are protected by the Fifth Amendment. Id.  at 491-92.  The United States Supreme Court addressed a similar issue in Baxter v. Palmigiano.  425 U.S. 308 (1976). In Baxter the respondent was advised of his right to remain silent in a prison disciplinary proceeding, but was warned that his silence could potentially be used against him. Id. at 312. The Court overturned the lower court's ruling that the privilege against self-incrimination barred adverse inferences from silence in penal proceedings. The Court found: Our Conclusion is consistent with the prevailing rule that the Fifth Amendment does not forbid adverse inferences against parties to civil action when they refuse to testify in response to probative evidence offered against them: the Amendment “does not preclude the inference where the privilege is daimed by a party to a Civil cause.” Id. at 318 (citations omitted).  The Court further clarified that, even though the objection to allowing adverse  inferences from silence in penal proceedings is genuinely rooted Fifth Amendment policy:  It has little to do with a fair trial and derogates rather than improves the chances for accurate decisions. Thus, aside from the privilege against compelled self-incrimination, the Court has consistently recognized that in proper circumstances silence in the face of accusation is a relevant fact not barred from evidence by the Due Process Clause. Id. at 319 (citations omitted).  This is not a criminal case. Respondent successfully raised his privilege against self-incrimination by refusing to answer discovery requests, refusing to answer deposition questions, and electing not to testify. at his Final Hearing. The Fifth Amendment provides  no further protection to a litigant outside of criminal court.  18 Response to Exception No. 11: Paragraph 84  Paragraph 84 of the RO states:  84. However, the allegations certainly put the Respondent on notice that his admitted multiple punctures to the internal organs in these two patients was a basis upon which the Petitioner sought to discipline his license. Respondent could have used interrogatories or the deposition of Petitioner’s expert to discern detailed ultimate facts regarding how Petitioner believed the negligence to have occurred.  Petitioner realleges and incorporates its General Response to the Sufficiency of the  AC and General Response to Complaints that Certain Facts were not Alleged in the AC.  The ALJ’s comment on the Respondent’s discovery opportunities did not  - improperly shift-the burden of proof to the Respondent. There is nothing nefarious about -  the ALJ highlighting the purpose of the discovery process. Because the ALJ’s comment on discovery did not depart from the essential requirements of law, Respondent's  exception should be denied.  Response to Exception No. 12: Paragraph 85  Paragraph 85 of the RO states:  85. The clear and convincing testimony of the experts was that organ punctures during liposuction are exceedingly rare complications which do not occur in the absence of recklessness in the placement of the cannula, and insufficient attention to the feel of the procedure itself as the cannula passes through fat, tissues, muscles, and the abdominal wall.  The ALJ’s summary of her factual findings as to the expert testimony in the case  was based on competent, substantial evidence and should not be disturbed.  19  ee ee ep ep ENE Nee Hee Net eran AS A ha A he RTT  Paragraph 85 summarizes the ALJ's factual determination of the totality of the experts’ opinions in this case. The ALJ weighed the credibility of each witness and found that organ punctures, such as the ones involved in this case, are rare complications that do not occur in the absence of negligence. (T. Vol. 1, p.151-158, 167-168; T. Vol. 2, p. 64-68) The ALJ gave less weight to the Respondent's expert’s testimony that even well- respected surgeons have punctured internal organs during liposuction. Again, Respondent seeks to have the Board re-weigh the evidence and overturn the implicit finding that Respondent’s expert testimony was less credible than Petitioner’s expert  testimony. Doing so is impermissible and Respondent's exception should be denied.  “To the extent that paragraph 85 contains conclusions of law, Responderit’s””  exception should be denied because the alternate conclusion proposed by the Respondent  is not as or more reasonable than that of the ALJ.  Response to Exception No. 13: Paragraphs 69, 92, and 93 Paragraphs 69, 92, and 93 of the RO state:  69. The record supports by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent signed or approved these records and bears responsibility for their accuracy. However, Respondent reviewed and signed the medical records, all of which omitted the additional ampule of epinephrine that was purportedly added, without correcting the apparent discrepancy.  92. Petitioner proved by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent failed to create or keep medical records that accurately reflected the amount of epinephrine administered to Patients L.L., D.M., N.F., and P.N.  93. Asa result, Petitioner proved by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated section 458.331(1)(m).  20  ee eae  nee ae eR DM  a eee Petitioner’s Response to Respondent’s Exceptions and for the reasons stated orally by the Petitioner.  9. Respondent’s Exception 9 to Paragraphs 59 and 60 of the Recommended Order is denied for the reasons set forth in the Petitioner’s Response to Respondent’s Exceptions and for the reasons stated orally by the Petitioner.  10. Respondent’s Exception 10 to Paragraphs 63, 64, 87, 88, and 89 of the Recommended Order is denied for the reasons set forth in the Petitioner’s Response to Respondent’s Exceptions and for the reasons stated orally by the Petitioner, and because the Board does not have the necessary substantive jurisdiction to address the Fifth Amendment self-incrimination issue raised by Respondent.  11. Respondent’s Exception 11 to Paragraph 84 of the Recommended Order is denied for the reasons set forth in the Petitioner’s Response to Respondent’s Exceptions and for the reasons stated orally by the Petitioner.  12. Respondent’s Exception 12 to Paragraph 85 of the Recommended Order is denied for the reasons set forth in the Petitioner’s Response to Respondent’s Exceptions and for the  reasons stated orally by the Petitioner. Petitioner realleges and incorporates its General Response to the Sufficiency of the  AC and General Response to Complaints that Certain Facts were not Alleged in the AC.  The ALJ's determination that Respondent bore responsibility for the inaccurate documentation of epinephrine concentration is based on competent, substantial evidence. The surgical records for each patient’s procedure show that Respondent was actively involved with their creation. (P. Exh. 2, P. Exh. 5, P. Exh. 9, P. Exh, 11) They bear his Signature at every stage of the process. There is no additional evidence necessary to  prove the records in evidence were created by Respondent.  Respondent argues, through his expert, that he is not responsible for records “documenting his own procedure bearing his own signature. (T. Vol. 2, p. 90-91) The AU's | ruling made it clear that this explanation was not credited and the Board cannot not re- weigh the evidence and change the ALJ’s credibility determination. As to the legal conclusions in Paragraphs 62, 92, and 93, Respondent's alternative conclusion is not as Or more reasonable than the ALJ’s. Based on the foregoing, Respondent's exception  should be denied.  WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that the Board of Medicine reject Respondent's exceptions and accept the Administrative Law Judge’s Findings of Fact,  Conclusions of Law, and Recommended Penalty.  21  Respectfully submitted,  {sfJohn_ Wilson  John Wilson, Assistant General Counsel : Florida Bar No. 84798 i John.Wilson@flhealth.gov  Florida Department of Health Prosecution Services Unit  4052 Bald Cypress Way, Bin C-65 Tallahassee, Florida 32399-3265 (P) (850) 245-4444 ext. 8167  (F) (850) 245-4662  ere  St ems  CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE I HEREBY CERTIFY that a true and correct copy of the foregoing has been furnished by email to Counsel for Respondent, Monica Felder Rodriguez, by email at monica@rplawfirdm.com, this 13th day of February, 2017.  /s/John Wilson John Wilson, Assistant General Counsel i Assistant General Counsel  22  FILED  DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH DEPUTY CLERK CLERK Amber Greene DATE 2 - q .

Petitioner requests Respondent's  Motion to Strike be denied for the reasons stated below:  1. A Recommended Order was filed in this case on January 6, 2017. The natural deadline for both parties to file exceptions was January 23, 2017.  2. On January 19, 2017, Respondent moved for an extension of time to file exceptions. Petitioner objected to the request.  3. The Department received notice that the Board granted Respondent's request later that day via email!. No formal order on the motion was ever issued.  4. Kristen Summers, formerly lead counsel for Petitioner in this case, resigned her  position with the Department effective January 25, 2016.  ! Counsel of Record for Petitioner was not copied on this email.  5. The transition of responsibility to co-counsel and the lack of a formal, written order on Respondent's Motion for Extension of Time lead to some confusion as to the filing deadline for Petitioner’s Exceptions.  6. Logic seemed to dictate that the filing deadline should be the same for both parties so that neither side had an extended opportunity to review the other party’s exceptions before filing their own.  7. Additionally, Respondent needed an extension of time to prepare his exceptions. Had Petitioner filed its exceptions on January 23, 2017, Respondent would have had to use the same ten-day time period to Respond to Petitioner’s Exceptions and complete his own exceptions, mandating that both Respondent’s Exceptions. and Respondent’s Response to Petitioner’s Exceptions be due at the same time.  8. Principles of fairness to both parties resulted in Petitioner’s understanding that its exceptions were not due until the same date as Respondent’s Exceptions were due, given the extension granted by the Chair for the Board of Medicine.  9. While Section 120.57(1)(k), Florida Statutes (2016), and Rule 28-106.217, Florida Administrative Code, set a fifteen-day filing window for exceptions, the Board should not strike Petitioner’s Exceptions given the above circumstances without considering whether the late filing was due to excusable neglect. Hamilton Co. Bad.  Of Co. Commins v. Deptt. of Env. Reg., 587 So.2d 1378 (Fla. ist DCA 1991).

OMULEPU, M.D., 2015-18000, 2015-19442, 2015-20428 Respondent. . /  RESPONDENT’S EXCEPTIONS TO THE RECOMMENDED ORDER  COMES NOW, Respondent, Osak Omulepu, MD., by and through undersigned counsel, and files these Exceptions to the Recommended Order in the above-referenced cases.  INTRODUCTION TO THESE EXCEPTIONS  The Recommended Order concluded that Dr. Omulepu violated Section 458.331(1)(t), Florida Statutes, because he fell below the standard of care by perforating a patient’s bowel and puncturing a patient’s liver during liposuction, and also concluded that Dr. Omulepu violated Section 458.331(1)@n), Florida Statutes, by failing to keep adequate medical records because the amount of epinephrine used in this case was incorrectly documented in the records that were prepared by others regarding acts they performed. Despite repeated objections  (and the filing of a Motion in Limine), the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) in this case (a) allowed evidence and testimony in this case that was outside the scope of the allegations in the Second Amended Administrative Complaint (AC), (b) made findings of fact outside the scope of the allegations in the AC, (c) made findings of fact that are not based on competent, substantial evidence, (d) made findings of fact for which there is no clear and convincing evidence, and (e) made improper negative inferences against Dr. Omulepu based on his decision not to testify in this matter. The ALJ’s admission of evidence that was not alleged in the AC, including hearing testimony from the patients and others regarding events outside the scope of the AC, clearly prejudiced and influenced her decisions in this case, resulting in a denial of due process for Respondent. These issues form the crux of most of the exceptions filed below.  As noted above, many of the facts found in the Recommended Order were not alleged in the Administrative Complaint, and basing findings of fact on conduct not alleged violates the Administrative Procedures Act. By failing to allege acts or omissions that the Department believes establish a violation of statutes, but attempting to prove those unalleged acts and omissions at trial, Respondent was denied reasonable notice of the facts or conduct warranting disciplinary action. Cottrill v. Dep’t of Insurance, 685 So.2d 1371, 1372 (Fla. Ist DCA 1996). It is well-established that a physician may not be disciplined for an  offense not charged in the complaint.” Tresvani v. Dep’t of Health, 908 So. 2d  Page 2 of 58  1108, 1109 (Fla.1st DCA 2005); see also, Gonzalez v. Department of Health, 120 So.3d 234, 237 (Fla. lst DCA 2013) (reversing where Department of Health considered matters not alleged in complaint; noting that “[a]dministrative hearing boards may not consider matters not formally charged in the administrative complaint in imposing disciplinary sanctions without violating due process.”) (citing Chrysler v. Dep’t of Prof’l Regulation, 627 So.2d 31, 34-35 (Fla. lst DCA  1993) (finding harmful error when administrative board discussed unrelated civil  malpractice case held in another state but not addressed in the administrative complaint).  Finally, it is important to note that a number of exceptions concern findings in the Recommended Order that either mischaracterize witness testimony, or incompletely quote testimony to support findings and inferences in the Recommended Order. Respondent requests that the Board carefully review the record for the testimony and evidence that purportedly supports these findings of fact to determine whether they truly support the findings of fact and conclusions of  law made by the ALJ.  The Board’s Review Requirements Under Chapter 120, Florida Statutes  In considering the Recommended Order of the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) herein, the Board of Medicine is confined solely to the review of the record  as established at the formal hearing. Ong v. Department of Professional  Page 3 of 58 Regulation, 565 So. 2d 1384, 1387 (Fla. 5th DCA 1990). Thus, the Board is not authorized to receive additional evidence other than that already presented and considered by the ALJ. Jd. Nor can the Board discipline a licensee for matters not charged in the Administrative Complaint. See Trevisani v. Dep’t of Health, 936 So. 2d 790, 795 (Fla. 1st DCA 2006); Ghani v. Dep’t of Health, 714 So. 2d 1113,  1114 (Fla. lst DCA 1998). Standard of Review of a Recommended Order  Section 120.57(1)(k), Florida Statutes, authorizes the submission of exceptions to a Recommended Order. In reviewing a Recommended Order of an ALJ, the Board of Medicine (“the Board’) must evaluate the individual findings of fact and conclusions of law under a “competent, substantial evidence” standard. §120.57(1)(1), Florida Statutes. Competent substantial evidence is defined as that evidence supporting an ultimate finding which is sufficiently relevant and material such that a reasonable mind would accept as adequate to support the conclusions reached, DeGroot v. Sheffield, 95 So. 2d 912, 916 (Fla. 1959).  In keeping with the requirement of a “competent substantial evidence” review, the Legislature has authorized the Board to reject any finding of fact set forth in a Recommended Order, when upon its review of the entire record before the ALJ, the Board determines that there is a lack of competent, substantial  -evidence upon which to base the particular finding of fact. Id; see also Heiferz v.  Page 4 of 58  Department of Business Regulation, 475 So. 23 1277, 1281-1282 (Fla. Ist DCA 1985); Gross v. Department of Health, 819 So. 23 997, 1000-1001 (Fla. Ist DCA 2002). In so doing, however, the Board may not reweigh the evidence presented, may not judge the credibility of the witnesses, and may not otherwise interpret the evidence to fit its desired ultimate conclusions. Heifetz, supra; Gross, supra.  In addition, the Board is authorized to reject or modify the conclusions of law over which it has substantive jurisdiction and to reject or modify interpretation of administrative rules over which it has substantive jurisdiction. §120.57(1)(1), Florida Statutes.  SUMMARY OF EXCEPTIONS TO FINDINGS OF FACT  The errors and omissions in the Recommended Order are so many, and are so intertwined and convoluted, that Respondent believes it is appropriate and will be helpful to present a summary of the nature of and the basis for the many specific exceptions to both the findings of fact and the conclusions of law in the Recommended Order.  Summary of Exceptions to Findings of Medical Malpractice  Respondent will first summarize multiple concerns with the two findings of  medical malpractice made in this case which we believe compel dismissal of the  malpractice violations found in this case.  Page 5 of 58  13. Respondent’s Exception 13 to Paragraphs 69, 92 and 93 of the Recommended Order is denied for the reasons set forth in the Petitioner’s Response to Respondent’s Exceptions and for the reasons stated orally by the Petitioner.  14. Respondent’s Exception 13 to Paragraph 100 of the Recommended Order is granted for the reasons set forth in Respondent’s written exceptions and the reference to the finding of aggravated factors as set forth in Rule 64B8-8.001(3) (h),  Florida Administrative Code, is stricken.  RULING ON PETITIONER’S EXCEPTIONS AND RESPONDENT’ S MOTION TO STRIKE EXCEPTIONS  The Board reviewed the Petitioner’s Exceptions and the Respondent’s Motion to Strike Petitioner’s Exceptions and voted to GRANT the Respondent’s Motion to Strike Petitioner’s  Exceptions.  FINDINGS OF FACT  1. The findings of fact set forth in the Recommended Order are approved and adopted and incorporated herein by reference. 2. There is competent substantial evidence to support the  findings of fact.  First, the AC on its face does not allege malpractice. The AC alleges simply that an injury occurred - bowel perforation and liver puncture - which all experts in this case agreed is a known complication of liposuction, and that the standard of care required Respondent not to have caused that injury. The simple fact an injury occurred does not create any inference or presumption of negligence. Section 766.102 (3)(b), Florida Statutes. To prove negligence, the Petitioner was required to allege and prove that the injury was proximately caused by a breach of the standard of care. Petitioner did no such thing. There is no allegation that Respondent acted negligently in this case, what he may have done that was negligent, or that such negligent conduct caused the injuries in these cases. In the absence of any allegations of negligent conduct by Respondent, the malpractice violations must be dismissed.  Second, there is no clear and convincing evidence in this case upon which a finding of negligence can be based. Although the ALJ makes a finding of fact that Respondent angled the cannula down negligently to cause these injuries, she notes in the Recommended Order that all the experts agreed it was not possible to tell with certainty what transpired. Rather than making this finding based on competent, substantial evidence (after admitting clear and convincing evidence of negligence did not exist), the ALJ made this finding because she made a negative  inference that is what must have occurred because Respondent invoked his fifth  Page 6 of 58 amendment privilege not to testify. See, paragraphs 87-88 of the Recommended Order. This negative inference does not constitute competent, substantial evidence, and thus the finding of violations of medical malpractice must be dismissed.  Third, it was clearly erroneous for the ALJ to have made any negative inferences from the fact Respondent elected not to testify in this matter. The law is clear that this is a penal proceeding, and licensees have the same right against sel f- incrimination as provided in criminal cases. The ALJ even cites the premiere case supporting that legal right in paragraph 71 of the Recommended Order (Vining v. Fla. Real Estate Comm’n, 281 So.2d 487, 491 (Fla. 1973). The law is also clear that no inference of guilt may be made from one’s exercise of the right to remain silent. Horne, Comm’n of Education v. Buhmeyer, 2003 WL 223220030 (Fla. Div. Admin. Hrgs. 2003); Marston v. State, 136 $o.3d 563 (Fla. 2014). Allowing a jury or judge to find a defendant or respondent must have committed acts alleged because he or she did not deny them essentially decimates the protection the Fifth Amendment provides. It follows that making a negative inference in this circumstance is a clear constitutional violation. The ALJ determined a negative  inference could be made based on a case involving discipline of prison inmates in a  Page 7 of 58  federal case.! In that case, the Supreme Court of the United States found that the prison disciplinary proceedings were civil, not criminal (penal), proceedings, that no criminal proceedings were pending, and that if the prisoners declined to testify, their silence could be used against them. This case is entirely different. This isa penal proceeding as noted in Vining, and the laws and protections provided to defendants in criminal cases apply in licensure discipline cases. Even in the case cited by the ALJ, the Court acknowledges that in penal proceedings, no inference of guilt may be made, stating “The Court has plainly ruled that it is constitutional error under the Fifth Amendment to instruct a jury in a criminal case that it may draw a negative inference of guilt from a defendant’s failure to testify about facts relevant to his case.” Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425 U.S. 308, 317 (1976). It was clear error for the judge to make negative inferences from the Respondent’s invocation of his Fifth Amendment privilege, and any findings of fact or conclusions of law made as a result of that inference must be dismissed (which includes both standard  of care violations)..  1 Note that the suggestion of a negative inference was initially raised by Petitioner for the first time in its Proposed Recommended Order, citing the case the ALJ cites. See Petitioners Proposed Recommended Order (PRO), PP 90. As this was first brought up in the Petitioner's PRO, Respondent did not have an opportunity to address it earlier.  Page 8 of 58  Summary of Exceptions to Findings of Medical Records Violations  Similar issues are present with respect to the medical records violations that were found in this case. First, there is no factual allegation in the AC upon which a finding of a violation may be based. The AC alleged Respondent used a certain amount of epinephrine, and that he documented use of that same amount of epinephrine. See, PP 9-10, 17-18, 24-25, and 29-30 of the AC. There is no allegation the Respondent documented anything incorrectly. In the absence of a factual allegation to support a violation, these charges must be dismissed.  Second, there is no clear and convincing evidence upon which a finding of a violation may be made. The AC alleges Respondent failed to create or maintain accurate records. The ALJ found that the circulators prepared the tumescent solution, and documented the medications used to prepare the tumescent solution in the records. There is no finding that Respondent created the records at issue.  He had no firsthand knowledge of the contents of the tumescent solution prepared by the nurses, and was not in a position to document what medications were put into the solution. Rather, although there is no such allegation in the AC, the ALJ found that Respondent was responsible for confirming the accuracy of the records created by the circulators. This is not an acceptable basis upon which a finding of  a violation may be made. In the absence of competent, substantial evidence that  Page 9 of 58 Respondent created the records at issue, there can be no finding of a medical  records violation, and the medical records violations must be dismissed.  Summary of Exceptions to the Admissibility of Evidence and Testimony Outside the Scope of the Administrative Complaint for the Purposes of Aggravation  At the outset of the hearing, Respondent objected to the admission of any evidence or testimony outside the scope of the AC. It was clear from the Petitioner’s list of exhibits and witnesses that it intended to introduce evidence and testimony unrelated to any facts in the AC. and which would be extremely prejudicial to Respondent if heard or reviewed. This included testimony from.the patients in these cases and the patient’s hospital records. The Petitioner argued that the evidence should be allowed because it goes to possible aggravating factors in the case, and that evidence of aggravating factors is not required to be pled in the AC. When it was evident the ALJ intended to allow Petitioner to put on this evidence, Respondent requested the hearing be bifurcated, so that any evidence of injuries would be heard only if a specific finding of a violation was made. This request was denied.  Respondent was unable to find any case law on this issue, but submits that when an agency wants to establish that the conduct of a licensee in a particular AC caused specific injuries in an effort to increase the penalty imposed in a particular  case, those injuries and the causation required to make that determination must be  Page 10 of 58  alleged in the AC so the licensee has notice of the Agency’s intent to rely on findings related to these injuries when a penalty is assessed, and the failure to include such factual allegations in the AC violates a licensee’s right to due process. See, Cottrill v. Dep’t of Insurance, 685 So.2d 1371, 1372 (Fla. Ist DCA 1996);  Ti resvani v. Dep’t of Health, 908 So. 2d 1108, 1109 (Fla. lst DCA 2005); Gonzalez v. Department of Health, 120 So.3d 234, 237 (Fla. Ist DCA 2013); Chrysler v. Dep’t of Prof’! Regulation, 627 So.2d 31, 34-35 (Fla. lst DCA 1993).  As the testimony of the patients and the hospital records were offered solely to prove injuries for the purposes of aggravation that were not alleged in the AC, this testimony and evidence should not have been allowed, and any findings related to that testimony or evidence should be excluded.  EXCEPTIONS TO FACTS AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW RELATED TO MEDICAL MALPRACTICE  Exception No, 1: Paragraphs 16 and 25  Respondent takes exception to the findings of fact in paragraphs 16 and 25 because these findings of fact were not alleged in the Administrative Complaint,  and should be stricken. These paragraphs state:  16. Because Patient D.M. disclosed her prior pregnancies to Respondent, Respondent knew, or should have known, that Patient D.M. had a potentially weak or thin abdominal wall.  Page 11 of 58 25. Because Patient N.F. disclosed her prior pregnancies to Respondent, Respondent knew, or should have known, that Patient N.F. had a potentially weak or thin abdominal wall.  The only allegations in the Administrative Complaint relevant to these findings are in paragraphs 11 and 19 of the AC, which state:  11. During the procedure, Respondent repeatedly punctured Patient D.M.’s liver.  19. During the procedure, Respondent repeatedly perforated Patient N.F.’s small bowel.  The corresponding violation alleged is discussed in paragraphs 33 and 37 of the Administrative Complaint, where it states that the standard of care requires Respondent not to puncture a patient’s internal organs, and in paragraphs 35 and 38 of the AC, where it states it is a violation of the standard of care to have injured these organs.  Thus, the AC alleges that the simple fact that the patients’ organs were damaged is below the standard of care. There is no allegation that Respondent performed the surgery negligently, or incorrectly, that he should have treated this patient differently for any reason, or that the patient suffered injuries that required treatment as a result of the alleged violation of the standard of care.  With respect to these findings, the fact these patient had children (and the fact they both had prior abdominal surgery) was raised during the hearing to  discuss how the known complication of damage to internal organs can occur  Page 12 of 58  during liposuction in the absence of negligence, citing factors present in this case that made it possible for the Respondent to have entered the abdominal cavity without being aware he had done so. T. Vol. 2, p. 129-130, 132-137. This was offered in response to the testimony from Petitioner’s expert witness that you can always feel the abdominal wall, and should know any time the abdominal wall is penetrated, and that Respondent must have angled the cannula improperly to have caused damage to internal organs. The testimony was also offered to counter the Petitioner’s allegation in the Administrative Complaint that any injury to internal organs is below the standard of care.  Instead of using that testimony for its intended purpose, the ALJ (at the behest of the Department in its Proposed Recommended Order) manipulated that testimony instead to make a negative finding (or at least a negative inference) that was not alleged in the AC in this case that Respondent had an even higher duty to use extraordinary care with these patients because of their prior pregnancies. In  fact, none of the experts testified as found in this paragraph.  The law is clear (and was cited in paragraph 74 the Recommended Order) that the facts used to prove a violation must be alleged in the Administrative Complaint. See, Trevisani v. Dept. of Health, 908 So.2d 1108 (Fla. Ist DCA  2005), and other cases cited above. The factual findings made in paragraphs 16  Page 13 of 58 and 25 were clearly not in the Administrative Complaint and should be rejected  and deleted, or amended to state the following:  16. Asaresult of Patient D.M.s prior pregnancies, it is possible that Respondent encountered little to no resistance from the abdominal wall, or that there was already a hole in the abdominal wall, which would explain the injury the patient sustained and why the injury was not suspected at the time of the surgery.  25. Asaresult of Patient N.F.’s prior pregnancies, it is possible that Respondent encountered little to no resistance from the abdominal wall, or that there was already a hole in the abdominal wall, which would explain the injury the patient sustained and why the injury was not suspected at the time of surgery.  Exception 2: Paragraphs 49 and 86 Respondent takes exception to paragraphs 49 and 86 of the Recommended Order, which state as follows: 49. After Patient N.F.’s hospitalization, her mother confronted Respondent who admitted that he “messed up,” and suggested that his instrument “cuts through muscle and fat like butter,” and may have contributed to the perforation. 86. Nevertheless, in this case, Respondent admitted to Patient N.F.’s mother that he “messed up” and sliced through Patient N.F.’s smal] bowel with his cannula like it was “butter.” Respondent files an exception to these paragraphs of the Recommended Order, as these findings do not constitute clear and convincing evidence because  they mischaracterize the witness’ testimony, are unrelated to any allegation in the  Administrative Complaint, do not support the violation alleged. The implication of  Page 14 of 58  these statements are prejudicial to the Respondent, and should be stricken from the Order.  It is important to note that the Respondent performed two separate procedures on this patient — liposuction and fat transfer. The Department in this case alleged that Respondent caused two separate injuries to Patient N.F. — the bowel perforation during liposuction and an injury to her sciatic nerve during the fat transfer (although the Department’ s expert testified this injury could also have been caused during the liposuction — see R. Exh. 4, p. 86). It is absolutely impossible to know from this witness’ testimony which procedure was being discussed — the liposuction or the BBL, which medical device the parties were discussing — the device for liposuction or for fat transfer, and what Respondent was referring to when he allegedly said he “messed up” — the perforation or the injury to the sciatic nerve.  In fact, the testimony from this witness is that Respondent explained to her that he was using a new device (testimony which was not supported by the testimony in this case, so is not a finding of fact), which the witness testified the Respondent said cuts through muscles and fat like butter. T. pg. 49. There is no indication which device is being discussed, and it is clear that the witness is talking about why her daughter is having trouble walking (a second separate injury alleged  in the AC), and not about the bowel injury. The ALJ assumes from the testimony  Page 15 of 58 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  1. The Board has jurisdiction of this matter pursuant to Section 120.57(1), Florida Statutes, and Chapter 458, Florida Statutes.  2. The conclusions of law set forth in the Recommended Order and, as amended in paragraph 14 on the ruling on the exceptions in this order, are approved, adopted and incorporated herein by reference.  PENALTY  Upon a complete review of the record in this case, the Board determines that the penalty recommended by the Administrative Law Judge be REJECTED. The Board finds that the following facts justify an increase in the severity of Respondent’s penalty:  1. This matter involved similar injuries to two different patients that occurred within the span of a single day that both required hospitalization. (Recommended Order Findings of Fact paragraphs 18-29)  2. The severe nature of injuries to patient D.M. involving multiple perforations of her liver. (Recommended Order  Findings of Fact paragraph 29)  that the device referred to is a liposuction cannula, but there is no clear testimony or evidence that this was the device being discussed, as different cannulas were used for various parts of the procedure.  The witness later testifies, in response to another question about whether Respondent admitted he made a mistake, that Respondent said he “messed up.” Again, there was no testimony regarding what Respondent may have been referring to when he allegedly made this statement. In fact, it is more likely than not that the witness was discussing the weakness in the patient’s legs when she questioned Respondent, as she was asking him why he didn’t see her or do more after she presented to the office complaining of being unable to walk. See T. Vol. 1, pgs. 47-50. The relevant parts of this testimony are as follows:  Q___~ What did that conversation with Dr. Omulepu involve?  RD. He—I asked him — first I spoke to him on the phone. And we made arrangements to meet at the hospital. And when — because I told him I wanted to look him in his eyes when he told me what he did to my daughter. And he when got to the hospital, we were outside. And he when got to the hospital, we were outside. He was back there with my daughter and I asked him can we go down to the patient lounges and speak. I’m sorry — and speak. So we went down to the patient’s lounge and I asked him again, what did you do to my daughter, what happened. And he told me that he was trying to figure out that himself. He said the only thing he could think of, he got a new tool and I said what do you mean you got a new tool? He said that he —  R.D. He described the difference in the two tools. The new tool compared to the old tool. The old tool had a safety mechanism on it or something that he said that if you went too deep, I guess it set off  Page 16 of 58  an alarm. And the new tool that he was using is used on morbidly obese. My question to him being, why did you use it on my daughter because she’s not even my size. And then he continued to explain this device. It cuts through muscles and fat like its butter. And I’m looking at him and so I asked him I said so, when my daughter told you she couldn’t walk, what did you do? You didn’t even bother to come to the back to the clinic to even check on her. You left that up to some nurses. And when even when she wasn’t getting any better with the fluids that they were giving her, you didn’t — ya'll didn’t even bother to —  Q = Ms.RD, during that conversation with Dr. Omulepu, did he admit that he made a mistake?  R.D. Yes. He say I messed up. I messed up. That’s all I can say is I messed up.  Further, assuming that the references were to the injury to Patient N.F.’s  bowel, a doctor admitting he caused an injury does not equate to an admission that  he acted negligently. Nothing in the testimony of this witness indicates that  Respondent admitted that he acted outside the standard of care during the  procedure, either by failing to perform the procedure with care, or by angling the  cannula incorrectly.  The ALJ goes further than the witness testimony to state in this finding of  fact that the statement that one of the instruments used “cuts like butter” may have  contributed to the perforation. This was not the testimony by this witness, and is a  conclusion the ALJ made independently.  Page 17 of 58  The testimony did not clearly describe an admission by Respondent that he damaged the patient’s bowel, nor is it clear when he allegedly stated he “messed up” that he was referring to the bowel injury, and not the other injury the mother was addressing (to the sciatic nerve). Thus, this testimony does not constitute clear and convincing evidence of negligence in this case. In the absence of competent, substantial evidence of negligence in this case (and in the absence of allegations of negligence), the ALJ is clearly trying to find some basis for finding a violation exists in this case, improperly contorting evidence to support a violation. These paragraphs should be rejected and deleted.  Exception 3:_Paragraph 52 — Facts Related to Damage to Internal Organs  Respondent takes exception to the finding of fact in paragraph 52 because this finding is unrelated to the allegations in the AC. This paragraph states:  Respondent was responsible for ensuring that the cannula used during liposuction procedures was manipulated with precision and extreme care to avoid contact with the patient’s internal organs.  This finding purports to set forth the standard of care that must be followed during liposuction procedures, but there is no similar factual allegation in the AC. Similarly, there is no factual allegation in the AC that Respondent failed to use precision or extreme care during these procedures. The allegation in the AC is  simply that it is below the standard of care, in and of itself, to damage a patient’s  Page 18 of 58 internal organs. Respondent was not put on notice that he would be accused of failing to use precision or extreme care at the hearing.  The law is clear (and was cited in paragraph 74 of the Recommended Order) that the facts used to prove a violation must be alleged in the Administrative Complaint. See, Trevisani v. Dept. of Health, 908 So.2d 1108 (Fla. Ist DCA 2005), and other cases cited above. Ifthe Petitioner believed Respondent acted negligently in this case, rather than alleging that any injury to organs is a violation of the standard of care, it was obligated to put the Respondent on notice of this in the AC by stating specifically how Respondent’s conduct was negligent? As the facts in this paragraph are not alleged in the AC, this paragraph should be rejected and deleted.  Exception 4: Paragraph 53 — Facts Related to Damage to Internal Organs  Respondent takes exception to the findings of fact in paragraph 53 because these findings are outside the scope of the allegations in the AC and are not based on competent, substantial evidence.  Paragraph 53 of the Recommended Order states:  In order for the cannula to come into contact with an internal organ (with the exception of the heart and lungs), Respondent pushed the cannula at an inappropriate angle through a thick layer of muscle  called the abdominal wall. The tough abdominal wall has a noticeably  ? Note that not only is the AC devoid of specific conduct that would constitute negligence, but Petitioner’s expert stated on several occasions that the simple fact an Injury occurred to internal organs is negligent, and that the fact _ this injury occurred, in and of itself, is a violation of the standard of care. See R. Exh. 4, p. 78-79, T. Vol. |, p. 168. This is the factual allegation Respondent defended against at the hearing.  Page 19 of 58  different consistency than the soft layers of subcutaneous fat. A  surgeon is required to operate with a level of care and skill to be able  to discern between subcutaneous fat and muscle tissue while passing  the cannula through the patient.  The ALJ’s own analysis of the evidence in the record of this case led her to  observe, at paragraph 63 of her Recommended Order, that:  As noted by all three experts, absent being present during the  procedure, having it well-documented in the Respondent’s notes, or  talking with Respondent, it is not possible to tell with certainty what  transpired. Having thus evaluated the quality of the evidence before her, it defies logic and common sense and ignores the deficiencies in the evidence for the ALJ, having concluded that it is not possible to tell what transpired, to also make a finding of fact that “Respondent pushed the cannula at an inappropriate angle through a thick layer of muscle called the abdominal wall.” There is no allegation, and no evidence, that the Respondent pushed a cannula at the wrong angle. All findings of fact in a case of this nature must be supported by “clear and convincing evidence.” It is hard to imagine anything further from clear and convincing than evidence from which it is not possible to tell with certainty what transpired.  As noted in part in paragraph 62 of the Recommended Order, Respondent’s  expert, Dr. Mendieta, testified that damage to a patient’s internal organs is a known  complication of liposuction that occurs in the best of hands. He was asked whether  one could negligently perforate an organ, and stated as reflected in paragraph 62 of  Page 20 of 58 the Recommended Order. See, R. Exh., p. 52-53. He certainly did not testify that is what occurred in this case. To the contrary, he testified that everything was done in this case the way it should have been done, and there is no basis for finding that Respondent did anything incorrectly. Jd. In fact, Dr. Mendieta testified that he once had a bowel perforation case that was investigated by the Board of Medicine and dismissed. See, R. Exh. 1, p. 13, 47, 51, 78.  As noted by the ALJ in the conclusions of law in paragraph 72 of the Recommended Order, “[cJlear and convincing evidence requires that the evidence must be ...precise and explicit and the witnesses must be lacking in confusion as to the facts in issue. The evidence must be of such weight that it produces in the mind of the trier of fact a firm belief or conviction, without hesitancy, as to the truth of the allegations sought to be established.” Ifit is not possible to tell with certainty what transpired, evidence does not meet the lower “preponderance of the evidence” standard, much less the.“clear and convincing evidence” standard required in this case.  The finding of fact then goes on to say that the cannula went through a thick layer of muscle called the abdominal wall, that this layer of muscle is noticeably different than subcutaneous fat, and that a surgeon must operate with the level of care and skill to be able to discern between subcutaneous fat and muscle. Again,  this is not a factual allegation in the Administrative Complaint, and Respondent  Page 21 of 58 was not put on notice that this was believed by Petitioner to be the standard of care, such that he would be required to defend against this allegation.  In making this finding, although not specifically stated, the ALJ is finding that the Respondent was negligent and did not operate with the level of care and skill required by failing to discern between subcutaneous fat and muscle. This is an inappropriate finding in the absence of similar factual allegations to put the Respondent on notice that he is being accused of this negligent conduct.  The law is clear (and was cited in paragraph 74 the Recommended Order) that the facts used to prove a violation must be alleged in the Administrative Complaint. See, Trevisani v. Dept. of Health, 908 So.2d 1108 (Fla. Ist DCA 2005), and other cases cited above. As this factual allegation regarding the standard of care was not in the AC, it should be rejected and deleted.  Furthermore, this factual finding is not based on competent, substantial evidence. In paragraphs 16 and 25 of the Recommended Order, the ALJ found that Patients D.M. and N.F. had, or potentially had, a weak or thin abdominal wall. It is axiomatic that the ALJ, upon making a finding based on clear and convincing evidence that a patient had or potentially had a thin abdominal wall, cannot later make a finding a patient had a thick abdominal wall. She reiterates that finding in  the following paragraph of the Recommended Order (paragraph 54).  Page 22 of 58  For the reasons set forth above, there is no clear and convincing evidence to support the findings in paragraph 53 and it should be rejected and deleted. Exception 5: Paragraph 54 — Facts Related to Damage to Internal Organs  Again, this paragraph purports to set forth the standard of care in Florida, as in paragraphs 52 and 53, stating:  The standard of care in Florida requires surgeons to use extreme care to ensure that the abdominal wall is not [breached]. This is especially true when the patient’s medical history suggests the possibility of a thin abdominal wall. Again, this fact is not alleged in the Administrative Complaint, nor it is based on the evidence or testimony in this case, and thus this finding is not based on competent, substantial evidence.  In making this finding, although not specifically stated, the ALJ is finding that the Respondent did not use sufficient care during the procedure so as to violate the standard of care. This is an inappropriate finding in the absence of similar factual allegations in the AC to put the Respondent on notice that he is being accused of this negligent conduct. There was also no evidence presented that Respondent failed to use extreme care in these cases.  Regarding the finding of a medical history suggesting a thin abdominal wall, see Exception 1 above. In addition, there was no testimony offered at the hearing  to support a finding of fact regarding the standard of care in Florida when a  Page 23 of 58  patient’s medical history suggests a finding of a thin abdominal wall, so this sentence is also not supported by competent, substantial evidence in this case.  As this finding of fact was not alleged in the AC, and it is not supported by clear and convincing evidence, it should be rejected and deleted.  Exception 6; Paragraph 56 — Damage to Internal Organs  In paragraph 56 of the Recommended Order, the ALJ cites testimony from Dr. Mendieta, Respondent’s expert, who the ALJ describes and accepts as a world- renowned BBL expert as follows:  “T’m constantly thinking bowel, bowel, bowel perforation or I’m constantly thinking trying to avoid, so it is constantly on my mind in terms of what I am trying to avoid, so I’m always angling my cannula and making sure that I’m on the right plane.  Respondent files this exception not because he disputes that Dr. Mendieta made these statements, but because the statements are not a complete and accurate representation of this testimony. The rationale for this finding of fact is not clear, but it was obviously used to support other findings made by the ALJ. However, a complete review of the testimony in this case shows Dr. Mendieta was responding to a question about negligent use of a cannula, and his answer clearly does not support that injury to internal organs constitutes a violation of the standard of care. See, R. Exh. 1, p. 46-48. Importantly, the next line after the passage cited above  shows that no matter how careful a surgeon is, these known complications may  Page 24 of 58 occur, when he states: “But it still happened tome.” A copy of the relevant  portion of Dr. Mendieta’s testimony follows: Q And what is the standard for the appropriate use of a cannula?  A I think every physician has got their own priority. It is like asking what is the appropriate hammer to use? Everybody has got different philosophies, different ideas. So there is no standard, really.  Q___ And what is the risk of misusing a cannula?  A A burn to the skin, obviously organ injury, structural injury, burns —  Q Is there anything that a surgeon can do to minimize these risks?  A Well, I’m thinking because there are certain patients that are a little bit of a higher risk to getting these things — to getting these injuries that you might be a litile bit more conservative on your — in your-——in your care. But even then, no matter how safe you are, sometimes you’ ll still — these complications will happen. That’s why we call them complications. For example, people that have like in the valen dream, you know I really went through everything in my head, because you absolutely feel horrible. I went through my head and reviewed everything that I could. I know that people who have a very lax or loose abdomen — sometimes you really can’t, because they’re so loose that you really can’t tell what plane you’re in. And you can accidentally be in there and not even know it. Some people have very hard, dense fat. So there is a tremendous amount of resistance. Imagine trying to push a closed locked door. And when you finally open it, it kind of over-opens it because you had so much force to do that you can accidentally go through the fascia. People that have a very high rib cage — and all these kind of people, I might angle my cannula a little bit differently, probably use more of a pinch technique whenever I’m doing liposuction. Those are probably a few of the safeguards that I’m constantly thinking bowel, bowel, bowel perforation or I’m constantly thinking trying to avoid, so it is constantly on my mind in terms of what I’m trying to avoid, so I’m always angling my cannula and making sure that I’m on the right  Page 25 of 58 WHEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED AND ADJUDGED: Respondent’s license to practice medicine in the State of  Florida is hereby REVOKED.  RULING ON MOTTON TO BIFURCATE AND RETAIN JURISDICTION TO ASSESS COSTS  Upon review of the Petitioner’s Motion to Bifurcate and Retain Jurisdiction to Assess Costs, the Board GRANTED the Petitioner’s Motion and will consider a Motion to Assess Costs at a future meeting.  (NOTE: SEE RULE 64B8-8.0011, FLORIDA ADMINISTRATIVE CODE. UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED BY FINAL ORDER, THE RULE SETS FORTH THE REQUIREMENTS FOR PERFORMANCE OF ALL PENALTIES CONTAINED IN THIS FINAL ORDER. )  RULING ON MOTION TO STAY PENALTY  At the hearing in this matter, counsel for Respondent made an ore tenus Motion to Stay the penalty in this matter. The Board denied the Respondent’s Motion.  DONE AND ORDERED this | Y day ph  2017.  BOARD OF MEDICINE  For Magdalena Averhoff, M.D., Chair  7  plane. But it still happened to me. And I talked to a lot of my buddies and presidents of the Society who actually he had had a bowel perforation himself. And most of these bowel perforations go unrecognized for several days, which is fascinating. I don’t know why, but — so what I found was that there was a lot of this bowel perforation that goes under-reported. It was a lot more common by my conversations with my colleagues that I respected who do this a lot. And that was a little bit surprising to me, because the literature had some cases in it and everything, but I was surprised at how many people, when I told them my story, they said — they came up to me afterwards and — like I said, I lecture, so I’m very honest. I’m talking about complications and all that kind of stuff. So people will afterwards come up to me and talk to me. So that’s how. That’s how 1 kind of found it interesting.  This Board should not allow a finding of fact that clearly is being mischaracterized and misused to support other findings of fact or conclusions of law. It appears the ALJ used this statement, in the absence of any other evidence or testimony on this issue, to support her finding of fact that Respondent did not use care during the procedure when it is intended to show that this injury occurs no matter how careful one is when angling the cannula, and the finding should be corrected to counter this misuse of testimony.  For the reasons set forth above, this paragraph should be amended to state: Respondent’s world-renowned BBL expert, Dr. Mendieta described how an internal organ can be damaged, in the absence of negligence, and despite the best efforts of the surgeon. In fact, he admitted that one of his patients had a bowel perforation, despite his best efforts to prevent such an injury, and that a number of other highly respected surgeons have had similar complications. It is clear from the  testimony in this case that damage to internal organs is a known complication that can occur in the absence of negligence.  Page 26 of 58  See R. Exh. 1, p. 46-48, 50-51.  Exception 7: Paragraph 57 — Damage to Internal Organs  In this paragraph, the ALJ makes a finding that causes an inference that is unsupported by the evidence. The paragraph states as follows:  Dr. Mendieta admitted that although perforating an internal organ is a “known complication” related to liposuction, it can result from medical negligence.  Again, the Respondent does not dispute the accuracy of this statement, but the statement is taken out of context, and is being used improperly to support a finding of negligence. This finding is based on testimony in R. Exh. 1, at pages 50-53, which states:  Q Okay. Did the respondent fall below the standard of care by perforating D.M.’s liver?  A Well, I mean it is acomplication. It is something that is known itcan happen. And it happens to all. It happens to the best ofus. I mean, I’m considered one of the world’s expert in this. And it happened. One of my other buddies what also a world’s expert, it happened to him. .  Qs Okay.  A You feel terrible when something like this happens. But I don’t know how to quite answer that because it is a complication that is known, so when it happens, nobody wants it to happen. And it is something that is devastating. But it can happen.  Q ___ But in the inverse of that, if it is a known complication, it is possible for it to occur without medical negligence. Right?  A Correct.  Page 27 of 58  Q ___ Butis the inverse also popular — possible that someone can do medical negligence and cause a known complication?  A Sure.  Q Okay. So even though it is a known, it is possible that he did something wrong?  A That would be hard to ascertain without having a conversation with him, just from what I read.  Q___—sCBut itis possible? A Well, anything is possible in this world, yeah.  Q___ But hypothetically, if this was not respondent — if you were just talking about bowel perforations or liver perforations in general?  A Well, I think you are going to find guys that are very dogmatic. And they’ll say that anytime you have any complication, that is below the standard of care — because nobody should be getting complications. But the problem is that complications do occur in the best of hands. So, just because he had the complication, it doesn’t mean it was medical negligence. But now you’re asking me in this particular case, did he commit the medical negligence. And from what I’ve reviewed, everything was done according to that — that anybody who is in practicing medicine would be — plastic surgery would be doing. So, based on the review of the records, I did not see anything that would lead me to conclude that there was medical negligence.  Q How would one negligently perforate an internal organ?  A I think grabbing that cannula and shoving it deep, angling it downwards where you are purposely trying to injure would be my — my guess. I mean, other than that, if you’re doing your liposuction the way you usually do it and you’re taking precautions — and again, I didn’t talk —I didn’t talk to him so I don’t know all the little nuances  Page 28 of 58  that I was telling you about. But yeah, I think that would — if you are purposely trying to harm the patient.  Q ___ But that wouldn’t necessarily be reflected in the records that you reviewed?  A No.  Q So, there’s no real way of knowing unless you were —  A That’s right. .  Q _ - there and talked to him?  A Yes, that’s what I mean, yeah.  Clearly, Dr. Mendieta’s conclusion was that just because Respondent had  this complication, it does not mean he was negligent, and that there was nothing in  the records that would lead him to believe there was medical negligence in this  case,  Although it is inferred in the finding of fact in paragraph 57, Dr. Mendieta  did not find any evidence in this case that would suggest Respondent committed  medical negligence in this case. For this reason, the finding of fact is incomplete  and misleading, and should not be used to support the finding at the end of this  section of the Recommended Order that Respondent violated the standard of care  by damaging the patient’s internal organs.  Page 29 of 58  Rather, this finding of fact should be amended to accurately reflect the testimony of Dr. Mendieta and the context of the testimony he gave, with the amendment stating as follows:  Dr. Mendieta admitted that although perforating an internal organ is a “known complication” related to liposuction, it can result from  medical negligence. However, no such evidence of medical negligence was present in this case.  Exception 8:_Paragraph 58 — Damage to Internal Structures  Respondent files an exception to paragraph 58 of the Recommended Order  as it mischaracterizes Respondent’s argument in this case. Paragraph 58 states: Respondent argues he is absolved of any responsibility for the puncture of internal organs because Patients D.M. and N.F. signed consent forms that included the risk of “damage to deeper structures, including nerves, blood vessels, muscles, and lungs.”  In his PRO, Respondent argued that the injuries to patients’ internal organs were known risks of surgery that were disclosed to the patients as part of the informed consent process, and that Section 766.102, Florida Statutes, prevents a finding of medical malpractice against a physician in this circumstance. To make a finding of medical malpractice in this case, Section 766.102(2), Florida Statutes requires the Petitioner to allege and prove that the injury resulted from negligent medical intervention, and to also allege and prove that the injury was not within the  necessary or reasonably foreseeable results of the procedure. See Respondent’s  Proposed Recommended Order, p. 26-28, 32-33 (citing the above statute), and 34-  Page 30 of 58  36. As Petitioner failed to allege or prove such allegations, Respondent argued in  his PRO and continues to argue here that the charges must be dismissed.  Regardless, this paragraph is not a factual finding, but a legal argument. The  paragraph should be deleted from the findings of fact. It will be addressed further  in the exceptions to the conclusions of law.  Exception 9: Paragraph 59 and 60 — Consent Issues  These paragraphs state, in essence, that the informed consent forms signed  by D.M. and N.F. do not cover damage to intra-abdominal organs. They state as  follows:  59. Significantly, the informed consent forms for liposuction signed by the patients did not include the damage to the liver, small bowel, or other intra-abdominal organs.  60. Petitioner’s expert, Dr. Greenberg, explained that the language in the consent forms does not contemplate damage to internal organs shielded by the abdominal wall, and a lay person would be unlikely to make such an inference.  The consent forms for both patients are identical on this issue, and are the  same forms used and promoted by the American Society of Plastic Surgery (their  logo is on the forms). The relevant portion of the form includes as a surgical risk:  Damage to Deeper Structures:  There is the potential for injury to deeper structures including nerves, blood vessels, muscles, and lungs (pneumothorax) during any surgical procedure. The potential for this to occur varies according to the type of procedure being performed. Injury to deeper structures may be temporary or permanent.  Page 31 of 58  P. Exh. 5, p. 43, P. Exh. 9, p. 44.  In addition to the consent forms, it is noted in the patient’s operative reports that prior to surgery, Respondent discussed the risks of surgery with the patient, including injury to deeper and surrounding structures. P. Exh. 5, p. 2, P. Exh. 9, p. 16.  Both of these statements are based on the testimony of Petitioner’s expert, Dr. Greenberg (see T. Vol. I, p. 75). However, this testimony is clearly not clear and convincing evidence, and should be disregarded, as it clearly contradicts the plain meaning of the language in the consent forms. Dr. Greenberg testified that deeper structures refers to only parts of the body in the subcutaneous space. He did not explain why he felt that deeper structures did not include abdominal organs, except to say that the consent should have specifically mentioned bowels if that was intended, as nerves, blood vessels and lungs are mentioned. As he does not adequately explain the basis for his opinion, which flies in the face of the plain language of the consent, this does not constitute clear and convincing evidence.  The term “deeper structures” is clear on its face, and includes deeper structures in the body. It is not required for the consent form to specifically list every deeper structure in the body for the deeper structures to be considered to be one of the risks that was disclosed to the patient. The consent form specifically  lists nerves, blood vessels and lungs, likely because these are not typically  Page 32 of 58  considered to be deeper structures, and thus had to be separately included to be covered. The fact these were specifically listed does not exclude any deeper structures not specifically listed.  For the reasons set forth above, Respondent requests that the Board find that Paragraphs 59 and 60 of the Recommended Order do not constitute clear and convincing evidence, amending paragraph 59 as follows, and deleting paragraph 60 in its entirety:  59. The informed consent forms for liposuction signed by the  patients include damage to deeper structures, which includes intra- abdominal organs.  Exception 10: Paragraphs 63, 64, 87, 88, and 89  The Respondent takes exception to the second and third sentences of Paragraph 63 and to all of Paragraphs 64, 87, 88, and 89 of the Recommended Order, which paragraphs read as follows:  63. As noted by all three experts, absent being present during the procedure, having it well-documented in the Respondent's notes, or talking with Respondent, it is not possible to tell with certainty what transpired. Respondent refused to testify on his own behalf. Respondent asserted his Fifth Amendment Privilege against self- incrimination, instead of clarifying any of the disputed issues.  64. Based on the forgoing, Petitioner demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that the puncture of the patients’ internal organs was the result of Respondent's violation of the standard of care and improper angling of the cannula during the procedures.  Page 33 of 58 87. Respondent's assertion of his Fifth Amendment Privilege against  self-incrimination permits the fact-finder to draw adverse inferences from his silence. Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425 U.S. 308 (1976).  88. The only inference that can be drawn is that Respondent violated the standard of care and committed malpractice by the reckless and improper angling of the cannula for these two procedures, resulting in the perforation of internal organs. 89. Petitioner proved by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated section 458.331(1)(t) by puncturing Patient D.M.'s liver multiple times and Patient N.F.'s small bowel. [Respondent takes exception to all of the underscored language in these paragraphs. | For reasons that are set forth in greater detail below, Respondent takes exception to the last two sentences of Paragraph 63 of the Recommended Order because, although it is true that Respondent chose not to testify at the hearing, asserted his Vining right to remain silent, and did not volunteer to clarify disputed issues, it is a violation of his rights under Vining and is a denial of due process for the ALJ to draw attention to those choices made by the Respondent. It is an even greater denial of Respondent's Vining rights and right to due process when in following paragraphs the ALJ concludes that she can draw adverse inferences from the Respondent's decision to remain silent. It is totally destructive of those rights  when the ALJ actually draws those adverse inferences and treats the Respandent's  silence as substantive evidence of his guilt.  Page 34 of 58 For reasons set forth here and in greater detail below, Respondent takes exception to Paragraph 64 because it contains allegations that are not in the Administrative Complaint, it contains statements that are incorrect, statements that are illogical, and statements which are not supported by the record in this case.  The most obvious illogical aspect of Paragraph 64 is the assertion that, ""based on the forgoing,"" there is clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent committed malpractice. The ""forgoing"" that is referenced in Paragraph 64 are the statements in Paragraph 63 to the effect that everyone agrees ""it is not possible to tell with certainty what transpired"" and that the Respondent decided to remain silent. It is totally illogical and contrary to common sense for the ALJ to conclude that on a record in which one cannot tell with certainty what transpired one can add silence to the record and end up with clear and convincing evidence.  Again, there was no allegation in the AC that Respondent performed the procedure negligently — it alleges only that the fact he had this injury was below the standard of care (per se negligence), and the Respondent may not be charged with conduct not alleged in the AC. Thus, it is inappropriate to make any findings of fact that Respondent should have performed the surgery in a certain way (with extreme care and precision) or that he performed the procedure in a certain way (by angling the cannula down), because no such facts were alleged inthe AC.

Ist DCA 1993).  Importantly, the ALJ agrees that the fact an organ puncture occurred, in and of itself, is NOT an act of medical negligence. In paragraph 86 of the Recommended Order, the ALJ finds:  An organ puncture during liposuction is not a per se act of medical negligence.  With this finding of fact, the violations in the AC must be dismissed, because that is the only violation alleged in the AC. As noted above, it is inappropriate and prejudicial for the ALJ or Board to allow findings of fact based on specific acts of alleged misconduct, because Respondent was not put on notice that he was being charged with performing the procedure in a manner inconsistent with the standard of care. Rather, he was on notice that the Petitioner believed the fact he injured a patient’s internal organs was, in and of itself, a violation of the standard of care. If the Petitioner wanted to prove that Respondent performed the procedure negligently by, for example, having incorrectly angled the cannula, due process requires Respondent be so notified, In addition to the cases cited above, see Fox v. Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners, 366 So.2d 515 (Fla. 1st DCA 1979). Once the ALJ agreed that the injuries did not constitute a-violation of the  standard of care in and of themselves, to find a violation, the ALJ had to make a  Page 36 of 58  finding the procedure was performed negligently - despite the fact no specific acts of negligence were alleged in this case (another fact with which the ALJ agrees in paragraph 83 of the Recommended Order, but then ignores). Again, as noted above, the ALJ does not make findings of negligence based on the evidence, which she admits are insufficient to make such a determination. Rather the ALJ bases findings of negligence on the negative inference she makes from Respondent’s decision not to testify, which was clearly error, as discussed below. It is a violation of due process both to make specific findings of negligence that were not based on the allegations in the AC, and to base those findings on the fact Respondent failed to testify to defend against the allegations.  For reasons set forth in greater detail below, Respondent takes exception to Paragraphs 87 and 88 because the statements in these two paragraphs are incorrect conclusions of law that are inconsistent with, and contradict, the holding in State ex rel. Vining v. Florida Real Estate Commission, 281 So.2d 487 (Fla., 1973). Again, adverse inferences from silence are not permissible in a license discipline proceeding in Florida.  For reasons set forth in greater detail below, Respondent takes exception to Paragraph 89 because it is an untrue conclusion that is not supported by the record  in this case..  Page 37 of 58 In Vining, the Florida Supreme Court quoted the following from Spevack v.  Klein, 385 U.S. 511, 87 S.Ct. 625, 17 L.Ed.2d 574 (1967):  ""We said in Malloy v. Hogan: 'The Fourteenth Amendment secures against state invasion the same privilege that the Fifth Amendment guarantees against federal infringement--the right of a person to remain silent unless he chooses to speak in the unfettered exercise of his own will, and to suffer no penalty . . . for such silence.’ 378 US. at 8, 84 S.Ct. at 1493, 12 L-Ed.2d at 659.  ‘In this context 'penalty' is not restricted to fine or imprisonment. It means, as we said in Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106, the imposition of any sanction which makes assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege 'costly.'  The Vining court then went on to add the following in its own words:  Id. at 491.  In our judgment, logic and reason demand that the rationale of Spevack be applied not only to disbarment proceedings, but as well to other types of administrative proceedings which may result in deprivation of livelihood. Certainly, threatened loss of professional standing through revocation of his real estate license is as serious and compelling to the realtor as disbarment is to the attorney. In succinct terms, it is our view that the right to remain silent applies not only to the traditional criminal case, but also to proceedings ‘penal’ in nature in that they tend to degrade the individual's professional standing, professional reputation or livelihood. Spevack v. Klein, supra; Stockham v. Stockham, 168 So.2d 320 (Fla.1964).  It is clear from the foregoing that a Respondent in a penal type proceeding  such as this one cannot be compelled to provide evidence in support of the  prosecution against himself and cannot be penalized for exercising his right to  remain silent. The law is also clear that no inference of guilt may be made from  Page 38 of 58 one’s exercise of the right to remain silent. Horne, Comm’n of Education v. Buhmeyer, 2003 WL 223220030 (Fla. Div. Admin. Hrgs. 2003); Marston v. State, 136 So.3d 563 (Fla. 2014). This point is also made in the very case upon which the ALJ here bases her misguided conclusion that she is permitted to make adverse inferences based on the Respondent's silence. In Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425 U.S. 308, 317 (1976), at pages 318 and 319, the Court stated: ~ Our conclusion is consistent with the prevailing rule that the Fifth Amendment does not forbid adverse inferences against parties to civil actions when they refuse to testify in response to probative evidence offered against them: the Amendment ""does not preclude the inference where the privilege is claimed by a party to a civil cause."" 8 J. Wigmore, Evidence 439 (McNaughton rev. 1961). In criminal cases, where the stakes are [Page 319] higher and the State's sole interest is to convict, Griffin prohibits the judge and prosecutor from _ suggesting to the jury that it may treat the defendant's silence as substantive evidence of guilt. Disciplinary proceedings in state prisons, however, involve the correctional process and important state interests other than conviction for crime. We decline to extend the Griffin rule to this context. (Emphasis added.) The essence of the holding in Baxter is that the Court has concluded that the prison disciplinary proceedings at issue in that case are more like civil cases than like criminal cases. Accordingly, the Court concluded that the adverse inferences that are permissible in civil litigation are applicable to prison proceedings like the ones at issue in Baxter. But the holding in Baxter is inapplicable to license discipline  proceedings in Florida because in Vining the Florida Supreme Court held that these  types of proceedings are analogous to criminal proceedings and that those who are  Page 39 of 58  Respondents in these types of cases are entitled to the same Fifth Amendment protections as are available to defendants in criminal cases. Thus, Baxter is inapplicable. Vining controls. The Respondent was denied due process by the ALJ's use of adverse inferences and he cannot be found guilty on the basis of adverse inferences drawn from his silence.  The effect of this inference was to shift the burden to the Respondent to prove he was not negligent, instead of requiring the Petitioner to prove the facts of this case. If a judge or jury is allowed to make a negative inference of guilt any time a defendant or respondent elects not to testify under the Fifth Amendment, there really is no protection afforded by this important constitutional right.  The law goes further to provide that agencies cannot adopt and apply a legal presumption against a licensee in the absence of specific authorization by the Legislature. McDonald v. Dep’t of Prof. Reg., 582 So.2d 660 (Fla. Ist DCA 1991). In McDonald, the Department of Professional Regulation urged the Board of Real Estate to adopt a legal presumption that effectively shifted the burden of proof to the licensee. In overturning an order imposing discipline, the Court stated:  Under the principle of strict construction applicable to disciplinary statutes and the principles set forth in the cases cited above, it follows that without any provision for a legal presumption in the disciplinary statutes, the agency lacks authority to adopt a legal presumption that effectively relieves it from having to prove specific acts of misconduct and shifts the burden of proving innocence to the licensee. We have  found no such statutory provision authorizing DPR or the Board to adopt or apply any presumption like that applied in this case. Thus,  Page 40 of 58  DPR, in urging the Board to adopt the presumption, and the Board, in _ applying the presumption to support the finding of guilt, greatly exceeded their statutorily delegated authority under Florida law. Id. at 664. The Legislature in Florida has not authorized an agency to make a negative inference against a licensee who invokes his or her right not to testify in administrative proceedings. To the contrary, the law clearly forbids such an inference.  Because Vining and later cases following Vining are the controlling case law on this issue, it was error for the ALJ to draw attention to the fact that the Respondent chose to remain silent, it was further error for the ALJ to draw adverse inferences from the Respondent's silence, and it was an erroneous denial of due process for the ALJ to conclude that adverse inferences drawn from the Respondent's silence constituted clear and convincing evidence of malpractice. The ALJ erred further in Paragraph 88 where she concludes that ""the only inference that can be drawn"" is an inference of malpractice. Quite to the contrary, on the record in this case the only proper inference that can be drawn from the totality of the evidence is that there is no competent substantial evidence that the injuries to the organs of Patient D.M. and/or Patient N.F. were caused by any act of malpractice of the Respondent.  In addition to the arguments set forth above, Respondent would like to point  out that the facts of this case are very similar to those in the Trevisani case. In  Page 41 of 58  this case, the ALJ agreed that without more information, “it is not possible to tell with certainty what transpired.” It is thus impossible to know exactly how the injury occurred, and without knowing how the injury occurred, it is impossible to determine whether any act or omission of the Respondent was or was not a departure from the applicable standard of care. There certainly was no evidence or testimony presented that Respondent performed this surgery differently than he did the other thousands of times he performed it, or even differently than he did on the other two patients in these cases, who did not have similar injuries. So we are to assume that although he usually does the procedure correctly, here he did it in a different manner? Based on what evidence?  In the Trevisani case, the Petitioner alleged that Dr. Trevisani fell below the standard of care by injuring a patient’s forehead and thigh during a liposuction procedure. The operative report describing what happened during surgery was missing in that case. The Recommended Order in that case, which was adopted by the Board and is part of the Final Order in this case, states:  47. Without an operative note (or some other form of detailed information regarding the manner in which the surgical procedures at issue were performed) it is virtually impossible to reach a reliable determination as to what caused the injuries on the patient's left thigh and forehead. On the basis of the record in this case, the causes of the forehead and thigh lesions observed on Patient F. V. on February 7, 1997, are unknown. Because the causes are unknown, it is also unknown whether such lesions were caused by act or omission by  Respondent. And, because no specific act or omission by Respondent has been identified as the cause of either lesion, it is impossible to  Page 42 of 58  determine whether any such unidentified act or omission, if any, might or might not have constituted a departure from the applicable standards of care.  66.  ....Although the expert witness testimony in this case contains several different opinions as to what might have been the cause of the injury to the patient’s left thigh, none of the experts could identify any specific act or failure to act, by Respondent that, in fact, was clearly the cause of the injury. Specifically, there is no clear and convincing evidence that during the liposuction procedure ..... there was anything improper about the manner in which Respondent performed the liposuction procedure.  The order goes on to discuss, in footnote 17, that:  Both of the expert witnesses who testified on behalf of Petitioner candidly admitted that they did not really know what had happened to cause the two lesions. Dr. Barnett thought the thigh lesion was ""most likely” caused by rough handling of the liposuction instruments, but conceded there were other possible causes, some of which might not be a deviation from the applicable standard of care. Dr. Mayl candidly stated that he did not have sufficient information upon which to form an opinion as to what caused the subject lesions. He also stated he did not have enough information to state whether Respondent deviated from the standard of care in any of the ways alleged in the Amended Administrative Complaint. Dr. Mayl also opined that even if Dr. Barnett's causation theory were to be correct, Respondent's handling of the liposuction instruments still might not be a departure from applicable standards of care. In Dr. Mayl's words, such complications are not ""entirely preventable."" .  The facts in this case are similar — there is no indication that Respondent performed the procedure negligently, and the ALJ admits that. Although there is no evidence to support it, Petitioner’s expert surmises as to how the injuries must have occurred, speculating that the Respondent incorrectly angled the cannula.  Respondent’s experts provided a number of other reasons the injuries could have  Page 43 of 58  occurred in the absence of negligence, which is why organ injuries are a rare, but known complication of liposuction. The ALJ and Board in Trevisani correctly concluded that evidence of the type described in the foregoing quotations was not clear and convincing evidence of any act of malpractice. The ALJ in this case should have reached the same conclusion because in this case there is no competent substantial evidence of any action or failure to act by the Respondent that was described by any expert witness as a deviation from any applicable standard of care. And it must follow logically that if there is no competent and substantial evidence of malpractice, there is certainly no clear and convincing evidence of malpractice.  Finally, in order to find Respondent guilty of a violation of medical malpractice pursuant to Section 458.331(1)(t), Florida Statutes, Petitioner must allege and prove all the elements of malpractice required under Chapter 766.102, Florida Statutes. Although these requirements were cited by the ALJ in paragraph  75 — 78 of the Recommended Order, the ALJ then essentially ignores them.  Section 766.102(2)(a), Florida Statutes, states that in order to prove a breach of the prevailing standard of care, the Petitioner must identify the standard of care, allege and prove that the Respondent breached this standard of care, and show that the  injury was not within the necessary or foreseeable results of the procedure when  Page 44 of 58 the intervention was taken with informed consent. Haas v. Zaccaria, 659 So.2d 1130 (Fla. 4"" DCA 1995). Furthermore, Section 766.012(3)(b) states: The existence of a medical injury does not create any inference or presumption of negligence against a health care provider, and the claimant must maintain the burden of proving that an injury was proximately caused by a breach of the prevailing professional standard of care by the health care provider. Clearly, the existence of a medical injury cannot create any inference or presumption of negligence. As the Petitioner did not identify the standard of care nor did it allege a breach of the standard of care in the AC, but simply alleged the injury was per se a violation of the standard of care, and the injury was reasonably foreseeable as a known complication, there is no basis for a finding of a violation in this case.  Accordingly, Paragraphs 63, 64, 87, 88, and 89 of the Recommended Order should be disregarded as erroneous and without support in the record and the Board's Final Order should not include any of the inferences mentioned in those paragraphs. Without those inferences there is nothing in the record that even comes close to clear and convincing evidence that the punctures of Patient D.M.  and Patient N.F. were caused by any act of malpractice by the Respondent and  therefore the charges in Count I and Count II of the Administrative Complaint  Page 45 of 58  A.

Creic| COC  7014 e120 DOO03 &?0b 8451 ere 2 3 a  Konda Felder Rafrigne2 A ,  a70b L444 yom ae oo must be dismissed in their entirety. Paragraphs 87-88 of the Recommended Order should be deleted, and the other paragraphs should be amended to state:  63. As noted by all three experts, absent being present during the procedure, having it well-documented in the Respondent's notes, or talking with Respondent, it is not possible to tell with certainty what transpired.  64. Based on the forgoing, Petitioner failed to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the puncture of the patients’ internal organs was the result of Respondent's violation of the standard of care. 89. Petitioner failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that  Respondent violated section 458.331(1)(t) by puncturing Patient D.M.''s liver and Patient N.F.'s small bowel.  Exception No, 11: Paragraph 84 After acknowledging that the AC in this case does not allege that Respondent improperly angled the liposuction cannula, in paragraph 84 of the Recommended Order the ALJ states the following: However, the allegations certainly put the Respondent on notice that his admitted multiple punctures to internal organs in these two patients were a basis upon which the Petitioner sought to discipline his license. Respondent could have used interrogatories or the deposition of the Petitioner’s expert to discern detailed ultimate facts regarding how Petitioner believed the negligence to have occurred. Again, this clearly shows that the ALJ is improperly shifting the burden to the Respondent in this case. Rather than requiring the Petitioner to state how it believes Respondent violated the standard of care, Respondent is supposed to play  twenty questions with DOH, making sure to ask the right questions to figure out  Page 46 of 58  what they may be alleging he did incorrectly. This is completely contrary to the law, and even to the cases cited by the ALJ in the Recommended Order. See, Cottrill v. Dep’t of Insurance, 685 So.2d 1371, 1372 (Fla. lst DCA 1996); Tresvani v. Dep’t of Health, 908 So. 2d 1108, 1109 (Fla.ist DCA 2005); Gonzalez v. Department of Health, 120 So.3d 234, 237 (Fla. lst DCA 2013); Chrysler v. Dep’t of Prof’! Regulation, 627 So.2d 31, 34-35 (Fla. Ist DCA 1993).  If the Petitioner wanted to find Respondent guilty of falling below the standard of care for negligently performing liposuction because he improperly angled the cannula during the procedure, that needed to be stated in the Administrative Complaint. If that had been alleged, the Respondent would have presented evidence and called witnesses who were present in the operating room to testify as to how the procedure was performed. That, however, was not the allegation. The Respondent defended the allegations in the AC, and the findings by the ALJ that are outside the scope of the AC violate Respondent’s right to due process.  For the reasons set forth above, the conclusion of law in paragraph 84 should be amended to state:  As the administrative complaint does not allege that Respondent improperly angled the cannula during surgery, or that he committed any other negligent act that caused or contributed to the injuries  sustained in these cases, there can be no finding that Respondent committed an act of medical malpractice in this case.  Page 47 of 58  Exception No. 12: Paragraph 85  Respondent files an exception to the conclusion of law in paragraph 85 because it is clearly false. In this paragraph, the ALJ states:  The clear and convincing testimony of the experts was that organ punctures during liposuction are exceedingly rare complications which do not occur in the absence of recklessness in the placement of the cannula, and insufficient attention to the feel of the procedure itself as the cannula passes through fat, tissues, muscles and the abdominal wall.  To the contrary, the testimony of all three experts was that damage to internal organs is a known complication of liposuction. Dr. Greenberg admitted both during his deposition and at the hearing that known complications are those that occur in the absence of negligence. R. Exh. 4, p. 20, T. Vol. 2, p. 61-62. He also admitted that organ damage is a known complication of liposuction. R. Exh. 4, p. 78-79, T. Vol. 2, p. 59. Although he acknowledges organ damage is a known complication of liposuction, Dr. Greenberg goes on to say that while complications can happen, there are some that should not occur, and organ damage is something that never occurs in the absence of negligence. R. Exh. 4, p. 78-79. T. Vol. 1, p. 152. Dr. Greenberg admits, however, that he has never before reviewed a case involving a bowel perforation, and is not aware of whether the Board agrees with his opinion that any time this complication occurs, it is automatically below the  standard of care. T. Vol. 2, p. 62. Dr. Greenberg also agrees that bowel  perforations are not a complication that must be reported to the Board as an  Page 48 of 58  adverse incident (presumably because it is a known complication of certain procedures). T. Vol. 2, p. 67. After that Dr. Greenberg discusses how an injury to an internal organ would occur, stating the things noted in the paragraph above. T.  Vol. 1, p. 152-155.  Although Dr. Greenberg made this statement during questioning by the Petitioner, on cross examination, he admitted that nothing in the evidence supports his opinion that the technique used during the liposuction was incorrect. T. Vol. 2, - p. 69. In addition, when asked to confirm his opinion that the injuries must have occurred because Respondent angled the cannula improperly, he did not state that  was Clearly how the injury had occurred. To the contrary he stated:  I believe that J said that that is likely what could have happened, yeah, _ yes.  This statement is clearly speculation. The ALJ agreed, finding in paragraph 63 the Recommended Order that is it clear that nobody knows what happened during these procedures.  Dr. Mendieta discusses known complications at length during his deposition, stating that even when surgeons do everything they can to minimize risk to a patient, complications sometimes occur even in the hands of the best doctors. He had this complication with a patient, and knows of other well-respected surgeons who have had this complication. R. Exh. 1, p. 46-48, 50-51. He specifically  testified that as a known complication, it is something that can occur without  Page 49 of 58 medical negligence. R. Exh. 1, p. 51, lines 12-15. He further testified that nothing in this case led him to a conclusion that there was medical negligence. R. Exh. 1, p. 52, lines 6-21.  Dr. Samson testified that organ damage is a known complication of liposuction at the hearing. He went on to discuss the definition of a known complication at length at the hearing, specifically stating that known complications are those that occur in the absence of negligence. T. Vol. 2, p. 95-96. Later in his testimony he again discussed that the fact this injury occurs, in and of itself, is not a violation of the standard of care because it is a known complication. T. Vol. 2, p. 128-130. Dr. Samson also testified that he found no reason to believe that the Respondent violated the standard of care during these surgeries. T. Vol. 2, p. 131- 132. He goes on to discuss at length how the injuries could have occurred in the absence of negligence. T. Vol. 2, p. 132-136.  Finally, this conclusion of law is not based on the facts found in the Recommended Order. There is no finding of fact that each of the experts testified as noted in this paragraph.  For the reasons set forth above, Respondent requests this conclusion of law be rejected and deleted as it is not based on facts in the Recommended Order, and  it is not based on competent, substantial evidence in this case.  Page 50 of 58  EXCEPTIONS REGARDING MEDICAL RECORDS  Exception No. 13: Paragraphs 69, 92 and 93  These disputed paragraphs of the Recommended Order state: 69. Therecord supports by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent signed or approved these records and bears responsibility for their accuracy. However, Respondent reviewed and signed the medical records, all of which omitted the additional ampule of epinephrine that was purportedly added, without correcting the apparent discrepancy. 92. Petitioner proved by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent failed to create or keep medical records that accurately reflected the amount of epinephrine administered to Patients L.L., D.M., N.F. and P.N.  93. Asaresult, Petitioner proved by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated section 458.331(1)(m).  Respondent disputes these findings of fact and conclusions of law because 1) they are not based on any allegation in the AC; 2) they are not based on competent, substantial evidence; and 3) they are not even based on the facts that the ALJ found in her order.  First, the law is clear that a licensee may only be disciplined for conduct specifically alleged in the AC. The ALJ cites several cases on this in paragraph 74 of the Recommended Order. Unfortunately, the ALJ was not following this legal precedent when she made these findings. Before looking at any evidence or testimony presented in this case, the AC on its face does not allege any facts upon  which these findings/conclusions may be made. There are only two sentences in  Page 51 of 58  the AC (repeated for each patient) that are relevant to this violation. They are all identical, and state the following:  Respondent used tumescent solution with a concentration of one part epinephrine per 4 million units.  Respondent’s medical records for Patient XX document that Respondent used tumescent solution with a concentration of one part epinephrine per 4 million units. See paragraphs 9-10, 17-18, 24-25, and 29-30 of the AC. These allegations of fact do not support a medical records violation. The facts allege the Respondent’s records document exactly what was used. In order to support a finding ofa violation, the AC had to contain facts alleging that Respondent documented something incorrectly.  “Predicating disciplinary action against a licensee on conduct never alleged in an administrative complaint .... violates the Administrative Procedure Act. Cottrill v. Dep’t of Insurance, 685 So.2d 1371, 1372 (Fla. 1st DCA 1996). As in this case, as in Cottrill, the administrative complaint contained references to statutory provisions that were alleged to have been violated, but did not allege any act or omission in violation of the statutes. The appellate court stated that “even though evidence was presented that might well support the recommended order’s findings” that a violation occurred, the Department never pleaded the facts that constituted the violations, and those findings of a violation were reversed. As no  facts were pled in this case that constitute a violation, no violation can be found.  Page 52 of 58  Second, the ALJ makes no finding that Respondent created the medical records that inaccurately documented the concentration of epinephrine used because he did not create those records. The circulators were the ones who prepared the tumescent solution, and are the only ones with personal knowledge of the contents of the solution. They documented the contents of the medication they prepared. This is acknowledged by the ALJ in paragraphs 43-44 and 65-66 of the Recommended Order. In paragraph 44 of the Order, the ALJ discusses why the circulators did not document the amount of epinephrine used. The ALJ did not find that Respondent had a duty to create these records, where he did not create the tumescent solution, and where he had no personal knowledge of the contents of the solution. Therefore, there is no clear and convincing evidence upon which to find a violation of Section 458.331(1)(m), Florida Statutes.  Next, assuming it is legal to hold Respondent accountable for a record he did not create, and for which he has no personal knowledge, it is necessary to point out that there was no testimony or evidence presented at the hearing to establish that Respondent co-signed the records created by the circulators. There is a line at the bottom right of the Operating Room Record Form, where the circulators documented the medications used in the tumescent solution, for the surgeon’s signature. No testimony or evidence was presented by anyone, including the  circulators, to establish that Respondent signed the records (these records, or any  Page 53 of 58  of the records in these cases). In addition, there certainly was no evidence presented that he reviewed the records or approved them.  In paragraph 68, the ALJ finds that Respondent is the physician who performed surgery on these patients (which was not in dispute), and then she goes on to find that the operative records for the surgeries performed bear at least similar signatures, some of which appear to read 0.0. Omulepu. That does not constitute clear and convincing evidence that Respondent co-signed the notes written by the circulators. In fact, the ALJ never makes a finding that Respondent signed any of the documents in this case (again, because she could not make that finding, as no evidence was presented on this issue). Rather, she simply asserts in paragraph 69 that the record supports by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent signed or approved the records, and bears responsibility for their accuracy. |  Further, even assuming that clear and convincing evidence was present to prove that Respondent co-signed the document at issue, the Operating Room Record Form, no evidence or testimony was presented to support a finding that in doing so, Respondent was assuming responsibility for the accuracy of the records. Certainly, there was no testimony to support this finding.  The only testimony presented about this was from Dr. Samson, who testified  that in his opinion and experience, the circulators prepare the tumescent solution,  Page 54 of 58 and they are responsible for documenting the composition of the solutions they prepare. He testified that recently, he has been told he must co-sign the records created by the circulators, which he does under protest, as he has informed them that is not his record. It is thus not a record he should change. He testified that in co-signing, he is not attesting to the accuracy of the records because that is supposed to be an independent recollection of something the circulators did, and is not something he did. T. Vol. 2, p. 90-91.  In the absence of testimony that Respondent was the one who signed any of the records at issue, and in the absence of testimony or evidence that by co-signing records, a doctor is confirming he has reviewed the record and thus becomes responsible for their accuracy, there is no clear and convincing evidence to support the findings in these paragraphs.  Finally, the allegation is that the Respondent failed to create or maintain accurate records. See paragraphs 56, 62, 68 and 74 of the AC. There was no evidence or testimony regarding failure to maintain records. This is also a requirement cited in a rule, not in the statute, and the ALJ did not find that the Respondent violated a rule (nor was this alleged in the facts of the AC). Thus, the only issue in this case is whether Respondent failed to create accurate records.  As noted in Lester v. Dept. of Prof. Reg’l, 348 So.2d 923 (Fla. Ist DCA  1977), a “statute must be strictly construed, and no conduct is to be regarded as  Page 55 of 58 ",2016,FL

Prior to that he had been treated by several other doctors at the same facility.  5. AM presented to Respondent with complaints of neck pain, bilateral knee pain and lower back pain. A urine drug screen obtained on AM's first visit was positive for oxycodone’,  6. Respondent adequately assessed AM’s complaints and symptoms and performed a completed history and physical examination. He correctly diagnosed AM with cervical spondylosis, hypertension, generalized anxiety disorder, obesity, chronic pain syndrome, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, lumbago, osteoarthrosis, cervicalgia, intervertebral disc disorder rotator cuff syndrome, and  displacement of cervical intervertebral disc.  ' Oxycodone is commonly prescribed to treat pain. According to Section 893.03(2), Florida Statutes (2008-2012), oxycodone is a Schedule I] controlled substance that has a high potential for abuse and has a currently accepted but severely restricted medical use in treatment in the United States. Abuse of oxycodone may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence.  DOH v. Laurence Mark Skoinik, M.D. ? DOH Case No. DOH 2013-13912 21412  7, On April 10, 2013, AM was prescribed oxycodone by a different doctor at the same facility. In addition to the oxycodone, on April 10, 2013, AM was prescribed Xanax’.  8. Respondent performed a urine drug screen (UDS) on August 2, 2013, which was positive for oxycodone (in the form of OxyContin) and negative for benzodiazepines, even though AM had received prescriptions for oxycodone and Xanax on his previous three visits.

Respondent’s medical records do not contain AM’s records for May 8, 2013, or August 2, 2013. There are electronic records for June 6, 2013, and July 5, 2013. Additionally, the Respondent’s medical records for AM are comprised of duplicate records from previous visits and do not  accurately reflect AM’s current condition or changes over time.  2 Xanax, a benzodiazepine, is the brand name for alprazolam and is prescribed to treat anxiety. According to Section 893.03(4), Florida Statutes, alprazolam is a Schedule IV controlled substance that has a low potential for abuse relative to the substances in Schedule HI and has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States. Abuse of alprazolam may lead to limited physical or psychological dependence relative to the substances in Schedule Ill.  DOH v. Laurence Mark Skolnik, M.D. 3 DOH Case No. DOH 2013-13912 21413  10.

Respondent failed to attempt, or failed to document attempting, alternate modalities of treatment for AM’s pain.  13. Respondent failed to medically justify, or failed to document medical justification for, prescribing Xanax for anxiety to AM.  14.

Section 458.331(1)(nn), Florida Statutes (2005-2009), provides that violating any provision of Chapters 456 or 458, Florida Statutes, or any rules adopted pursuant thereto, is grounds for discipline by the Board of Medicine. Section 458.326, Florida Statutes (2005-2009), authorizes licensed physicians to prescribe controlled substances under Schedules II, III, IV and/or V to a person for treatment of intractable pain, provided that the physician does so in accordance with that level of care, skill and treatment recognized by a reasonable prudent physician under similar conditions and  circumstances.  In Re: Administrative Complaint 48 Barry M. Schultz, M.D. License No. ME 67047 Case No. 2011-05081 99. The State of Florida Board of Medicine promulgated Rule 64B8-9.013, Florida Administrative Code (F.A.C.), which is part of the chapter of the Florida Administrative Code where the Board of Medicine establishes standards of care for physicians, and provides in relevant part:  64B8-9.013 Standards for the Use of Controlled Substances for the Treatment of Pain. (1) Pain management principles.  (a) The Board of Medicine recognizes that principles of quality medical practice dictate that the people of the State of Florida have access to appropriate and effective pain relief. The appropriate application of up-to-date knowledge and treatment modalities can serve to improve the quality of life for those patients who suffer from pain as well as reduce the morbidity and costs associated with untreated or inappropriately treated pain. The Board encourages physicians to view effective pain management as a part of quality medical practice for all patients with pain, acute or chronic, and it is especially important for patients who experience pain as a result of terminal illness. All physicians should become knowledgeable about effective methods of pain treatment as well as statutory requirements for prescribing controlled substances.  * x *  (b) The Board recognizes that controlled substances, including opioid analgesics, may be essential in the treatment of acute pain due to trauma or surgery and chronic pain, whether due to cancer or non-cancer origins. The medical management of pain including intractable pain should be based on current knowledge and research and includes the use of both pharmacologic and non- pharmacologic modalities. Pain should be assessed and  In Re: Administrative Complaint 49 Barry M. Schultz, M.D. License No. ME 67047 Case No. 2011-05081 30mg; Patient M.D., 3,980 tablets of oxycodone 30mg; Patient S.G., 3,600 tablets of oxycodone 30mg; Patient H.G., 2,880 tablets of oxycodone 30mg and 1,700 tablets of methadone 10mg; Patient G.N., 7,020 tablets of oxycodone 30mg; Patient S.B., 4,192 tablets of oxycodone 30mg; Patient K.F., 2,460 tablets of oxycodone 30mg and 2,400 tablets of methadone 10mg; and, Patient B.F., 7,752 tablets of oxycodone 30mg.  9. Respondent told the department and law enforcement that he was the only person who ordered the controlled substances for his dispensary, and that he personally dispensed each tablet of oxycodone 30mg for the price of $1.60 and 100 tablets of methadone 10mg for $30.00.  10. On or about December 1, 2010, a second search warrant and a court order for patient files were served at Respondent's clinic. The medical records for patients H.K., J.K., P.G., R.L., M.D., S.G., H.G., G.N., S.B., K.F., and B.F. were obtained. The patient files were reviewed by an independent pain management expert who is a Florida physician certified by the American Board of Physical Medicine ene BeryM. Schult, MD. °  License No. ME 67047 Case No. 2011-05081 In Re:  treated promptly, and the quantity and frequency of doses should be adjusted according to the intensity and duration of the pain. Physicians should recognize that tolerance and physical dependence are normal consequences of sustained use of opioid analgesics and are not synonymous with addiction.  (c) The Board of Medicine is obligated under the laws of the State of Florida to protect the public health and safety. The Board recognizes that inappropriate prescribing of controlled substances, including opioid analgesics, may lead to drug diversion and abuse by individuals who seek them for other than legitimate medical use. Physicians should be diligent in preventing the diversion of drugs for illegitimate purposes.  (d) The Board will consider prescribing, ordering, administering, or dispensing controlled substances for pain to be for a legitimate medical purpose if based on accepted scientific knowledge of the treatment of pain or if based on sound clinical grounds. All such prescribing must be based on clear documentation of unrelieved pain and in compliance with applicable state or federal law.  (e) Each case of prescribing for pain will be evaluated on an individual basis. The Board will not take disciplinary action against a physician for failing to adhere strictly to the provisions of these standards, if good cause is shown for such deviation. The physician’s conduct will be evaluated to a great extent by the treatment outcome, taking into account whether the drug used is medically and/or pharmacologically recognized to be appropriate for the diagnosis, the patient's individual needs including any improvement in functioning, and recognizing that some types of pain cannot be completely relieved.  (f) The Board will judge the validity of prescribing based on the physician’s treatment of the patient and on available documentation, rather than on the quantity and chronicity of prescribing. The goal is to control the patient's pain for its duration while effectively addressing other Administrative Complaint Barry M. Schultz, M.D.  License No. ME 67047 Case No. 2011-05081  50 In Re:  aspects of the patient’s functioning, including physical, psychological, social, and work-related factors. | The following standards are not intended to define complete or best practice, but rather to communicate what the Board considers to be within the boundaries of professional  practice. * * *  (2) Standards. The Board has adopted the following standards for the use of controlled substances for pain control:  (a) Evaluation of the Patient. A complete medical history and physical examination must be conducted and documented in the medical record. The medical record should document the nature and intensity of the pain, current and past treatments for pain, underlying or coexisting diseases or conditions, the effect of the pain on physical and psychological function, and history of substance abuse. The medical record also should document the presence of one or more recognized medical indications for the use of a controlled substance.  (b) Treatment Plan. The written treatment plan should state objectives that will be used to determine treatment success, such as pain relief and improved physical and psychosocial function, and should indicate if any further diagnostic evaluations or other treatments are planned. After treatment begins, the physician should adjust drug therapy to the individual medical needs of each patient. Other treatment modalities or a rehabilitation program may be necessary depending on the etiology of the pain and the extent to which the pain is associated with physical and psychosocial impairment.  (c) Informed Consent and Agreement for Treatment. The physician should discuss the risks and benefits of the use of controlled substances with the patient, persons designated by the patient, or with the patient’s surrogate or guardian if the patient is incompetent. The patient should receive prescriptions from one physician and one pharmacy Administrative Complaint Barry M. Schultz, M.D.  License No. ME 67047 Case No. 2011-05081  51 In Re:  where possible. If the patient is determined to be at high risk for medication abuse or have a history of substance abuse, the physician should employ the use of a written agreement between physician and patient outlining patient responsibilities, including, but not limited to: 1. Urine/serum medication levels screening when requested; 2. Number and frequency of all prescription refills; and 3. Reasons for which drug therapy may be discontinued (i.e., violation of agreement).  (d) Periodic Review. At reasonable intervals based on the individual circumstances of the patient, the physician should review the course of treatment and any new information about the etiology of the pain. Continuation or modification of therapy should depend on the physician’s evaluation of the patient’s progress. If treatment goals are not being achieved, despite medication adjustments, the physician should reevaluate the appropriateness of continued treatment. The physician should monitor patient compliance in medication usage and related treatment plans.  (e) Consultation. The physician should be willing to refer the patient as necessary for additional evaluation and treatment in order to achieve treatment objectives. Special attention should be given to those pain patients who are at risk for misusing their medications and those whose living arrangements pose a risk for medication misuse or diversion. The management of pain in patients with a history of substance abuse or with a comorbid psychiatric disorder requires extra care, monitoring, and documentation, and may require consultation with or referral to an expert in the management of such patients.  (f) Medical Records. The physician is required to keep accurate and complete records to include, but not be limited to:  Administrative Complaint Barry M. Schultz, M.D. License No. ME 67047 Case No. 2011-05081  52 November 24, 2010, Respondent failed to practice medicine within Rule 64B8-9.013(3), F.A.C., in the treatment of Patient H.K., by prescribing one or more of the above-listed controlled substances to  the patient in the quantities and combinations described above  1.

Instructions and agreements; and  9. Periodic reviews.  Records must remain current and be maintained in an accessible manner and readily available for review.  (g) Compliance with Controlled Substances Laws and Regulations. To prescribe, dispense, or administer controlled substances, the physician must be licensed in the state and comply with applicable federal and_ state regulations. Physicians are referred to the Physicians Manual: An Informational Outline of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, published by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, for specific rules governing controlled substances as well as applicable state regulations.  100.
