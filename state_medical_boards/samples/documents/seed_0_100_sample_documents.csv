Petitioner is the state department charged with regulating the practice of medicine pursuant to Section 20.43, Florida Statutes; Chapter 456, Florida Statutes; and Chapter 458, Florida Statutes.  2. At all times material to this Complaint, Respondent was a licensed physician within the state of Florida, having been issued license number ME 39592.  3. | Respondent's address of record is 8890 West Oakland Park Blvd., Suite 300, Sunrise, Florida 33351.  J:\PSU\MEDICAL\DAVID PIUS\CASES\LEONARD 07-32189\AC_LEONARD_07-32189.D0C 4, At all times material to this Complaint, Respondent engaged in the practice of medicine as an Ophthalmologist, and is Board Certified in Cataract and Implant Surgery.  5. The Respondent first diagnosed patient W.B., a fifty-two year- old male, with cataracts in both eyes in 2007. The Respondent recommended implanting a new type of intra-ocular lens (IOL), called a Crystalens®, which was expected to correct W.B.’s cataracts and eliminate his need for reading glasses as well. The surgery was performed on W.B.’s left eye on August 7, 2007.  6. After the procedure, W.B. reported improved vision for reading and computer use, but reported that his distance vision was still blurry.  ‘ie Respondent contacted the lens manufacturer, as well as colleagues using the Crystalens® IOL, to discuss why patient W.B. did not have a better result, to determine whether implanting a Crystalens® in the right eye was advisable, and if it was, how to achieve a better result.  8. It was decided that the Respondent would implant a +18.0 diopter Crystalens® in W.B/s right eye, and if there was no posterior vaulting, exchange it for a +19.0 diopter one.  9. Onor about September 11, 2007, patient W.B. was admitted to Foundation For Advanced Eye Care (FFAEC) for the scheduled cataract surgery of his right eye.  J:\PSU\MEDICAL\DAVID PIUS\CASES\LEONARD 07-32189\AC_LEONARD_07-32189.DOC 2 10. The two different powers of Crystalens® were available in the operating room for implantation, with determination of the correct power to be made just prior to implantation.  11. During the surgery Respondent placed the +18.0 diopter lens, completed the surgery, and sent W.B. to the post-anesthesia recovery room (PAR). While he was still in the PAR, the Respondent realized that she had become confused as to the appropriate lens to use given her intraoperative clinical findings, and that the +19.0 diopter lens should have been implanted.  12. The Respondent discussed the error with W.B. while he was still in the PAR and he consented to a return to the operating room so the incorrect +18.0 lens could be removed and the correct +19.0 lens could be implanted. This was done without incident, and W.B. reportedly healed well from the surgery.  13. Section 456.072(1)(bb), Florida Statutes (2007), provides that performing or attempting to perform health care services on the wrong patient, a wrong-site procedure, a wrong procedure, or an unauthorized procedure, or a procedure that is medically unnecessary or otherwise unrelated to the patient's diagnosis or medical condition, constitutes  grounds for discipline by the Board of Medicine.  J:\PSU\MEDICAL\DAVID PIUS\CASES\LEONARD 07-32189\AC_LEONARD_07-32189.DOC 3 14. Respondent inserted a +18.0 diopter lens into patient W.B.‘s right eye instead of the intended +19.0 diopter lens.  15. Based on the foregoing, Respondent violated Section 456.072(1)(bb), Florida Statutes (2007), by performing a wrong procedure.  16. WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that the Board of Medicine enter an order imposing one or more of the following penalties: permanent revocation or suspension of Respondent's license, restriction of practice, imposition of an administrative fine, issuance of a reprimand, placement of Respondent on probation, corrective action and/or any other  relief that the Board deems appropriate.

Respondent continued to prescribe to PL multiple prescriptions  for large amounts of the above mentioned controlled substances in  excessive and or inappropriate quantities and or combinations during the  remainder of the treatment period.  6510  9. During the treatment period Respondent’s medical records fail to show in her evaluation of the patient and in her treatment plan one or more of the following: °  a) A basis in the medical record to justify the amount, frequency, and or combination of the controlled substances that Respondent prescribed to PL including but not limited to Oxycontin, Roxicodone, Lorcet, Xanax, Valium, Soma, and Oxydose.  10. Respondent’s medical records show that PL was prescribed concurrent prescriptions of Xanax and Valium, which are without any psychiatric referral.  11. Respondent’s medical records have no indication for the prescription of Xanax 2 mg four times a day along with Valium three times a day. There is no indication in the records supporting chronic Xanax use.  12. In view of the very high amount of benzodiazepines being prescribed it would have been appropriate to have referred this patient to other board certified specialists in pain management and or referrals to a  psychiatrist, no referrals were ever made.  “6511  FACTS SPECIFIC TO PATIENT TG 13. , Respondent's medical records state that she treated Patient TG for chronic pain during the treatment perlod. °  14. Respondent throughout this time prescribed TG inappropriate and excessive quantities and combinations of Xanax and Valium on multiple occasions.  15. While Respondent prescribed these controlled substances in very high dosages to TG, Respondent's medical records fail to justify the course of treatment involving the concurrent prescription of both Valium and Xanax in that there is no appropriate diagnoses of a chronic anxiety condition warranting the concurrent prescription of two benzodiazepines.  16. In order to prescribe Xanax or Valium over the treatment period in the quantity and frequency prescribed a psychiatric assessment or diagnosis would need to be established and this is not apparent from the medical records. None is documented.  17. During the treatment, despite the fact that Respondent concurrently prescribed both Valium and Xanax in very high quantities to  patient TG, Respondent failed to refer TG to a psychiatrist for further  assessment of a chronic anxiety disorder.  6312  FACTS SPECIFIC TO PATIENT DB  18. During the treatment period Respondent prescribed to DB controlled substances including Oxycontin 240 mg twice’a day in combination with six Roxicodone 30 mg tablets and soma four times a day together with Xanax twice a day.  19. The foregoing controlled substances were prescribed in excessive and inappropriate quantities and combinations throughout the treatment period, and respondent's medical records do not justify the course of treatment involving prescription of these controlled substances which were not within the standard of care.  20. During the treatment period, while Respondent prescribed these controlled substances in very high dosages to DB, on multiple visits Respondent's medical records fail to show one or more of the following:  a) Justification for the prescription of such high doses of OxyContin in conjunction with Roxicodone; b) Justification for the prescription Xanax twice a day in that  there is the mention of an anxiety diagnosis;  6591  STATE OF FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH  DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, Petitioner, v.

PL presented as a 47 year old female with a history of lumbar spine surgeries and concomitant unresolved chronic pain issues; PL was treated by Respondent between June 2006 and June 2009, (the treatment period) and during that time Respondent prescribed to PL, in the first month concurrent prescriptions of 60 Oxycontin 40 mg, 240 Roxicodone 30 mg, 100 Lorcet 10/650 mg, 120 Xanax 2mg, 60 Valium 10mg, 120 Soma 35 mg, 60 cc Oxydose, 60, Fiomal and 30 Depakote ER 500mgd; subsequently Respondent also prescribed PL Percocet and Seroquel.  8. Respondent continued to prescribe to PL multiple prescriptions for large amounts of the above mentioned controlled substances in excessive and or inappropriate quantities and or combinations during the remainder of the treatment period.  9. During the treatment period Respondent's medical records fall to show in her evaluation of the patient and in her treatment plan one or  more of the following:  6539  a) Acomplete medical history and physical examination that was conducted and documented in the medical record;  b) Discussion In the physical examinations of Respondent’s psychological diagnosis of anxiety disorder;  Cc) Documentation of neurologic findings, specific ranges of motion, reflex testing, documentation of a functional exam such as for activities of daily living, squatting, straight leg raising, or other appropriate diagnostic tests to assess radiculopathy or neurologic deficit.  d) Appropriate diagnostic testing for illicit drug use and drug diversion of opiolds was done sporadically, though Urine drug testing was used; however, in some cases they were aberrant, but not adequately documented. On September 2, 2007, there was a positive result for THC (Tetrahydrocannabinol jis the principal psychoactive constituent of the cannabis plant) without any notification on the urine drug test. It wrongly states that the patient passed and no appropriate counseling was documented despite this aberrant urine screen.  e) A basis in the medical record to justify the amount,  frequency, and or combination of the controlled substances that  6540  Respondent prescribed to PL including but not limited to Oxycontin, Roxicadone, Lorcet, Xanax, Valium, Soma, Oxydose and Fiornal.  10. Respondent’s medical records show that PL was prescribed concurrent prescriptions of Xanax and Vallum, which are without any psychiatric referral.  11. Respondent’s medical records have no indication for the prescription of Xanax 2 mg four times a day along with Valium three times a day. There is no indication in the records supporting chronic Xanax use.  12. The record clearly shows that PL suffered from depression. A note from Florida Disability Determination Services dated March 17, 2008 states the patient was feeling anxious and depressed. PL had depression for a long period of time. Based on this documentation it would be within the standard of care to refer this patient out for further psychiatric assessment.  13. Respondent's own medical records note that that this patient is clearly not doing well from a psychiatric standpoint; yet high doses of benzodiazepines are continued. ,  14. While clearly there is evidence in the medical record to suggest that patient PL was depressed, despite multiple references in the chart to  6541  PL being tearful and sad, for reasons unknown Respondent did not think that PL was actually depressed.  15. Despite the documentation in PL’s chart supporting the referral of this patient for assessment by a trained psychiatrist, no referrals were ever made.  16. In view of the very high amount of benzodiazepines being Prescribed it would have been appropriate to have referrred this patient to other board certified Specialists in pain management and or referrals to a Psychiatrist, no referrals were ever made.  FACTS SPECIFIC TO PATIENT SY  17. Respondent's medical records state that she treated Patient SY for chronic pain between June 7, 2006 to April 15, 2009, (the treatment period); SY had already been treated by other physicians as an established patient at Respondent's clinic.  18. SY presented with neck and back pain and recurrent pelvic pain resulting from endometriosis (a medical condition in which cells from the lining of the uterus (endometrium) appear and flourish outside the uterine  cavity, most commonly on the ovaries).  6542 19, During the treatment period Respondent prescribed to SY controlled substances including Oxydose, Roxicodone, Soma, Restoril, Dilaudid, Methadone, Soma, Trazodone, and Xanax.  20. Respondent continued to prescribe to SY multiple prescriptions for large amounts of the above mentioned controlled substances in excessive and or inappropriate quantities and or combinations during the remainder of the treatment period.  21. Between approximately June 7, 2006 to April 15, 2009, while Respondent prescribed these controlled substances in very high dosages to SY, Respondent's medical records fail to show in her evaluation of the patient and in her treatment plan one or more of the following:  a) A complete medical history and physical examination that was conducted and documented in the medical record;  b) Justification for the extent of controlied substances being prescribing, and or an appropriate diagnoses to warrant the prescriptions that are written;  c) Appropriate diagnostic testing for illicit drug use/diversion  of opioids.  6543  6594  Respondent will pay such Department costs to: Payments, Department of Health, Compliance Management Unit, Bin C-76, P.O. Box 6320, Tallahassee, FL 32314-6320,  within ninety (90) days from the date of filing of the Final Order. All costs shall be  paid by cashier's check or money order. Any change in the terms of payment of costs imposed by the Board must be approved in advance by the Probation  Committee of the Board. RESPONDENT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE TIMELY PAYMENT OF THE  COSTS IS HIS/HER LEGAL OBLIGATION AND RESPONSIBILITY AND RESPONDENT AGREES TO CEASE PRACTICING IF THE COSTS ARE NOT PAID AS AGREED IN THIS SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT. SPECIFICALLY, IF RESPONDENT HAS NOT RECEIVED WRITTEN CONFIRMATION WITHIN 105 DAYS OF THE DATE OF FILING OF THE FINAL ORDER THAT THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE COSTS NOTED ABOVE HAS BEEN RECEIVED BY THE BOARD OFFICE, RESPONDENT AGREES TO CEASE PRACTICE UNTIL RESPONDENT RECEIVES SUCH WRITTEN CONFIRMATION FROM THE BOARD.  4. Drug _ Course — No later than one year of the date of filing of the Final Order, Respondent shall complete the course ""Prescribing Controlled Drugs: Critical Issues and Common Pitfalls of Misprescribing"" sponsored by the University of Florida, or a Board-approved equivalent, and shall submit documentation of such completion, in the form of certified copies of the receipts, vouchers, certificates, or other official proof  of completion, to the Board’s Probation Committee.  DOH v. Sharlene D. Robinson, M.D,, Case Numbers 2005-03645, 2006-15435, 2008-09446, & 2009-06688 Medical Settlement Agreement v. 6-20-2013 4  d) Documentation of neuromuscular function, reflex testing, and specific ranges of motion, signs or symptoms of radiculopathy, neurologic deficit or other functional levels of activity.  €) Documentation in the physical examinations or medical records to Support the amount and combination of controlled substances  f) The nature and intensity of the pain is not accurately discussed. There is no discussion of anxiety disorder, no discussion of psychological function.  j) SY on several visits was on Oxydose, Roxicodone, Soma, Xanax, and Restoril, Roxicodone, Dilaudid, methadone, Soma, trazodone, and Xanax. Methadone has also been prescribed at various visits and at one time SY refused methadone though dearly has been tolerant to methadone and used It in the past. None of these changes in treatment plans are adequately described or discussed.  22. The physical examinations that have been performed were non- pain focused and non-orthopedic or musculoskeletal in nature. The followup physical examinations fail to note physical and objective findings, there is no documentation of neuromuscular function, reflex testing,  specific ranges of motion, signs or symptoms of radiculopathy, neurologic  6544  deficit or other functional levels of activity.  23. Respondent failed to refer SY to a psychiatrist for further assessment of a chronic anxiety disorder. None is documented. In order to prescribe Xanax or Valium over the treatment period in the quantity and frequency prescribed a psychiatric assessment or diagnosis would need to be established and this is not apparent from the medical records.  24. The Respondent's treatment plan is limited to the prescribing of controlled substances. There are no instances where other modalities or treatments were tried. No epidurals, pain management procedures, local injections, physical therapy, aquatic therapy, or other board certified Specialties have ever been involved in SY’s treatment.  25. The Respondent's medical records show that there were many instances of substance misuse; On September 9, 2007, Respondent's Progress note states the patient states she runs short. However, she States the pain control Is good. On December 12, 2007 Respondent's Progress note states, the patient Is asking for more medications. She states her pain has increased and there has been decreased relief. This is despite a very high-dose of medication. Dilaudid was added on that visit in  addition to the oxycodone prescribed without medical records to justify the  63545  Concurrent prescription of two similar immediate release oploids.  26. On May 27, 2008 Respondent's progress note states SY mentions using her sister's oxycodone. This is not explored further.  27. There are no diagnostic studies of the cervical or lumbar area documenting significant pathology that would correlate with abnormalities and clinical examinations.  28. There are no dinical examinations performed that would support the prescribing of controlled substances at the level documented in SY’s treatment.  29. The Respondent fails to adequately or appropriately address Certain issues in the urine screen such as the use of THC. This was not followed up. The patient was positive for THC on May 30, 2007 and was also positive for THC on October 17, 2007 and on January 23, 2009. Respondent’s progress note states that the patient should not use marijuana, though it does not appear that additional urine drug testing was performed.  30. Despite the foregoing, Respondent continued to prescribe controlled substances while SY continued to use Marijuana as a  recreational drug instead of Respondent discontinuing opioid management  6546  and tapering SY off opioids and referring the patient out to a substance abuse specialist.  31. The continuation of non-controlled substances would be appropriate and the utilization of other more conservative means of treatment would be appropriate in this patient.  32. Though there are many instances Correlating with these visits where the patient is running out medications, using too much, or borrowing medications from others, Respondent failed to address instances of SY running out of medications. This happened on multiple occasions but no corrective action was taken, such as Respondent tapering SY off immediate release opioids and Substituting extended release medications to manage chronic and persistent pain or referral too a substance abuse specialist.  33. On various visits, Immediate release opioids are provided in combination. On February 6, 2008, 120 Dilaudid tablets in addition to 375 Roxicodone tablets are prescribed. On January 23, 2009, Oxydose liquid is also prescribed in addition to oxycodone 30 mg tablets. Oxydose liquid is a potent immediate release form of oxycodone with a high abuse potential  and should not be prescribed in conjunction with Roxicodone, Soma,  6547  Xanax, and Restoril unless appropriate reasoning and documentation is provided, which Respondent did not do in this case. FACTS SPECIFIC TO PATIENT BT  34. Between June 6, 2006 through May 4, 2009 (the treatment period) Respondent treated BT for chronic pain; BT a 54 year old male Patient initially presented to Respondent with complaints of neck pain arising from moderate degenerative changes in the cervical spine with a diffuse disc bulge at C5-C6 with mild impingement on the spinal cord with moderate bilateral intervertebral neural foraminal stenosis.  35. During the treatment period Respondent prescribed to BT controlled substances Including Oxycontin, Oxydose, Roxicodone, Soma, methadone, Percocet, Trazodone, Morphine Sulphate (immediate release), Morphine Sulphate (controlled release) and Xanax.  36. Between approximately June 6, 2006 through May 4, 2009, Respondent prescribed oxycodone, Methadone, Xanax Morphine Sulphate Roxycodone Oxycodone, Oxycontin Oxydose, Percocet and Soma to BT in inappropriate and excessive amounts and combinations which were not within the standard of care and without medical records justifying the  course of treatment.  6548  37. During the treatment period, while Respondent prescribed these controlled substances in very high dosages to BT, on multiple visits Respondent's medical records fail to show in her evaluation of the patient and In her treatment plan one or more of the following:  a) A complete medical history and physical examination that was conducted and documented in the medical record;  b) Despite clear documentation indicating BT was misusing medications why no change was made in treatment plan to address this important issue;  C) Medical record justifying the prescribing of two immediate release opioids such as Oxydose and Roxicodone throughout the course of treatment from 2007 through 2009 where high doses of Roxicodone 30 mg tablets are prescribed in addition to Xanax, Oxydose liquid, and OxyContin.  38. In light of the amount of opioids being prescribed there Is no documentation to indicate that BT was seeing a board certified pain management specialist or seeing an interventional specialist who may have provided other alternative means of treating this patient's pain,  39. Considering BT was on a very high dose of opioids, no other  treatment modalities were explored such as physical therapy, interventional  6549  treatment, and non-opioid adjuvant medications, there were no referrals to surgeons, psychiatrists and board certified pain specialists to assist in management.  40. Respondent failed to refer BT to a board certified pain specialist to explore other modalities and interventions as well as to refer the Patient to a psychiatrist to explore other underlying psychiatric and/or psychological diagnoses.  41. Respondent's periodic physical examinations are extremely cursory and show limited information; there is no review of individual  _ Musculoskeletal systems, common neurologic testing, or even basic documentations of range of motion; while the physical examinations document tenderness and pain, there are no specific diagnoses other than generalized pain that are ever mentioned.  42. On multtiple visits, BT showed signs of substance misuse and lack of appropriate Improvement with prescribed medications without this being addressed by the Respondent, no change in treatment plan was ever performed and despite the foregoing Respondent failed to discontinue immediate release opioids and substitute an around the clock opioid when  issues of noncompliance were found.  6550  43. There is also no documentation of acute anxiety disorder to warrant the prescribing of Xanax and no additional psychiatric or psychological referrals were ever made, the prescription of Xanax Is also unwarranted in view of the fact that on multiple visits BT stated subjectively that Xanax as prescribed was not helping him and despite the foregoing, Respondent mentions In her notes of increasing the dosage to 2mg per day.  COUNT ONE  44. Petitioner reincorporates and realleges paragraphs 1 through 43 as if fully set forth herein.  45. Section 458.331(1)(nn), Florida Statutes (2007, 2008 and 2009), provides that violating any provision of chapters 456 or 458, Florida Statutes (2007, 2008 and 2009), or any rules adopted pursuant thereto, is grounds for discipline by the Board of Medicine.  46.

The followup physical examinations fail to note physical and objective findings, there is no documentation of neuromuscular function, reflex testing, specific ranges of motion, signs or symptoms of radiculopathy, neurologic  deficit or other functional levels of activity.  19. Respondent failed to refer WD to a psychiatrist for further assessment of a chronic anxiety disorder. None is documented. In order to prescribe Xanax over the treatment period in the quantity and frequency prescribed a psychiatric assessment or diagnosis would need to be established and this is not apparent from the medical records.  20. The Respondent's treatment plan is limited to the prescribing of controlled substances. There are no instances where other modalities or treatments were tried. No epidurals, pain management procedures, local injections, physical therapy, aquatic therapy, or other board certified specialties have ever been involved In WD’s treatment.  21.

SCARBOROUGH, M.D.,  Respondent.  / FINAL ORDER  THIS CAUSE came before the BOARD OF MEDICINE (Board) on April 5, 2013, in Deerfield Beach, Florida, for the purpose of considering Respondent’s offer to voluntarily relinquish his license to practice medicine in the State of Florida. (Attached hereto as Exhibit A.) Said written offer of relinquishment specifically provides that Respondent agrees never again to apply for licensure as a physician in the State of Florida.  Upon consideration of the written offer of voluntary relinquishment, the charges, and the other documents of record, and being otherwise fully advised in the premises,  IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Respondent’s Voluntary Relingquishment of his license to practice medicine in the State of Florida is hereby ACCEPTED, and shall constitute discipline  upon Respondent's license.  and as a medical assistant. V.A. had no medical training other than an at-home  , medical assistant course through Penn and Foster, for which she received no certificate or licensure. However, Respondent refers to V.A. as a nurse practitioner and tells patients that she is a nurse.  12. Shortly after V.A. began working at the clinic, Respondent began having her work with patients in an exam room. V.A.’s duties included taking patients’ blood pressure, reviewing patients’ current medications and writing out orders for X-rays and lab work. V.A. also reviewed and interpreted lab results and patients’ statements regarding their medical conditions , and made recommendations based on those interpretations. For example, if V.A. saw that a patient’s lab results reflected high cholesterol, she would enter a prescription for cholesterol-lowering medication into the computer system so that Respondent only had to print it and sign it. Respondent sometimes reviewed the lab data himself, but often made treatment and prescribing decisions based on V.A.’s interpretations alone. V.A. also administered intramuscular injections, including Vitamin B12 _  ' and testosterone injections, to patients at the clinic.  13. V.A. saw between 12 and 20 patients per day. In a sworn interview  with FDLE Agents, V.A. stated that she did not make recomimendations for _ medication adjustments for patients that Respondent failed to see at all, but she  regularly was the only person who saw recurring patients who only needed refills  38153 on their routine medications. Respondent would simply sign prescriptions for  , these patients without seeing them. V.A. stated that many of these patients were taking Lortab and Percocet as “just about everyone of [Respondent's] patients” took pain medication. According to V.A., Respondent routinely failed to see about 25% of the patients. However, on a particular day just prior to Christmas 2009, V.A. saw 40 patients, all of whom needed refills on pain medications and none of whom saw Respondent.  , 14. Lortab is the brand name for a drug that contains hydrocodone and is prescribed to treat pain. According to Section 893.03(3), Florida Statutes (2010- 2011), hydrocodone, in the dosages found in Lortab, is a Schedule III controlled substance that has a potential for abuse less than the substances in Schedules I and II and has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States. Abuse of hydrocodone may lead to moderate or low physical dependence or high psychological dependence.  15. Percocet is the brand name for a drug that contains oxycodone and is prescribed to treat pain. According to Section 893.03(2), Florida Statutes (2010- 2011), oxycodone is a Schedule I controlled substance that has a high potential for abuse and has a currently accepted but severely restricted medical use in treatment in the United States. Abuse of oxycodone may lead to severe  - psychological or physical dependence.  38154 16. Starting in approximately January 2011, Respondent instructed V.A. to start seeing his patients at Macclenny Nursing and Rehabilitation (Macclenny Nursing), a nursing home, as he stated that he did not always have time to see them. On most weekday afternoons, V.A. went to Macclenny Nursing to review | patients’ charts and lab results and to speak to the patients about any medical complaints they had. [If patients needed medication adjustments, V.A. would sometimes call Respondent from Macclenny Nursing. However, the course of treatment Respondent implemented was based on V.A.’s examination of the patients, V.A.’s evaluation of the patients’ lab results and records and, often, V.A.’s recommendations. If V.A. did not speak to Respondent about a particular patient while at Macclenny Nursing, she typed up a medical record, briefed the doctor and made recommendations for treatment upon her return to the clinic. On average, V.A. saw four to five patients per day at Macclenny Nursing. Respondent went to Macclenny Nursing to see his patients within 24 hours of V.A. seeing them because Macclenny Nursing had a strict requirement that the patients be seen by a doctor. However, during a sworn interview with FDLE agents, V.A. could not recall any instances where Respondent disagreed with her “diagnosis or treatment” recommendations. |  17. According to V.A., staff at Macclenny Nursing or a home health  agency sometimes called the clinic regarding the results of a patient’s PT/INR test  38155 (a test to determine the clotting levels of blood). In those instances, V.A. took the phone call and made the determination to adjust the patients’ Coumadin prescriptions and only told Respondent she had done so after the fact. Initially, when these calls came in to the clinic, V.A. took the call, consulted with Respondent, and relayed the information to caller. On one occasion, staff at Macclenny Nursing called the clinic regarding Patient M.R., who was experiencing a urinary tract infection. Respondent instructed V.A. to “just prescribe something” and V.A. prescribed Cipro. On another occasion, staff at Macclenny Nursing called to report that a patient’s Coumadin level was low. V.A. instructed the staff to increase the dosage and only later informed Respondent of the conversation. Respondent told her that she had made the right decision, and, from that point on, he allowed her to adjust medications on her own.  18. Coumadin is a brand name for warfarin and is a drug used to prevent blood clots from forming or worsening. Coumadin ‘is a legend drug, but not a: controlled substance.  19. Cipro is a brand name for ciproflaxin and is an antibiotic used to treat infections, including urinary tract infections. Cipro is a legend drug, but not a  controlled substance.  38156 Treatment of Patients by C.A.  20. C.A. is V.A.’s twenty-one-year-old daughter. She began working at Respondent’s clinic when she was thirteen and worked there until September 2011. C.A. only completed school through tenth grade, does not have a GED and has no medical training whatsoever. However, Respondent referred to her as a “nurse,” just as he did with his other unlicensed staff.  21. C.A.’s duties included taking patients’ vitals, reading patients’ lab results and talking to patients about their complaints. When patients came to the clinic for refills on their medications, C.A. entered the prescriptions into the computer database and Respondent would sign the prescriptions once staff printed  _ them. According to C.A., Respondent changed prescriptions that C.A. wrote about twice per day. C.A. saw approximately 15 to 30 patients per day, which amounted to approximately half of the total patients seen at the clinic.each day. Respondent did not always examine all of the patients that C.A. saw. Sometimes, he would simply enter CAYs exam room, make “small talk” with the patients and then leave. C.A. also administered intramuscular injections, including B12 and testosterone, approximately three days per week.  22. According to C.A., patients often come to the clinic 30 to 45 minutes  before Respondent arrives so that they can be evaluated and waiting for him upon  38157  9 his arrival. On some occasions, patients enter the clinic through the back door of the building, instead of entering through the patient entrance, and see Respondent without a record to document their visits. Other patients have their family members see Respondent on their behalf. Respondent regularly receives calls on his cell phone and instructs employees to contact pharmacies. and order prescriptions for patients. For some of these instances, Respondent instructs staff to generate medical records for patients who did not visit the office as though they had presented to the office for examinations. In those instances, staff enters artificial blood pressure readings and other information for the patients into fictitious medical records so that the patients’ insurance companies can be billed for visits that did not occur.  23. Itis especially common for Respondent to write prescriptions or give ‘samples to employees’ family members without requiring them to present for an office visit. For example, Dr. Scaborough prescribed medications for L.D.’s sister-in-law, M.B., or L.D.’s husband, M.B.D., without seeing them. L.D. would simply ask Respondent to prescribe medications for them without having them come to the clinic. On one instance, M.B. was suffering from dental pain and L.D. spoke to Respondent, who prescribed Lortab for M.B. without any contact with M.B. and without generating any medical record for the incident.  24. On another instance, L.D. asked Respondent for a prescription for  38158  Xanax for M.B.D. Respondent approved it even though it had been several months since M.B.D.’s last visit with Respondent, and L.D. had it filled at a local pharmacy.  25. Xanax is the brand name for alprazolam and is prescribed to treat _ anxiety. According to Section 893.03(4), Florida Statutes (2010-2011), alprazolam is a Schedule IV controlled substance that has a low potential for abuse relative to the substances in Schedule III and has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States. Abuse of alprazolam may lead to limited physical or psychological dependence relative to the substances in Schedule II.  26. Respondent pushes his staff to move through patient visits extremely quickly. He used to tell his staff that he needed to see 40 patients per day to “make payroll.” After he hired T.D., he began stating that he needed to see 60 patients per day to “make payroll.” He also told staff that treating the patients was not “rocket science.” During a sworn interview with FDLE agents, V.A. stated that when she asked Respondent to see patients for whom he already signed prescriptions he said, “I’ve already signed your patient’s scripts, get “em out and get another one in there.” Several times, V.A. told the clinic receptionists not to schedule new patients due to the large volume of patients in the clinic, but Respondent countermanded her each time. Instead, he instructed the receptionists  that they were definitely seeing new patients with the “good insurance.”  38159 27. Ona particular day in early 2011, Respondent was ill and unable to see any patients at all. He spent the entire day lying down in his office. V.A. and A.S. saw all of the patients that day and only consulted with Respondent to have him sign the prescriptions for the patients. According to V.A., Respondent did not know what he was signing. On that date, V.A. also saw one patient with a new complaint that consisted of an ulcerated leg wound for which V.A. recommended treatment and prescribed antibiotics.  28. On or about April 5, 2011, Baker County Sheriff's Deputy R.S. (Deputy R.S.) initiated a traffic stop on C.L.', a twenty-year-old male, who was driving recklessly. Upon stopping the vehicle, Deputy R.S. asked C.L. for consent to search the vehicle, but C.L. refused consent. Shortly thereafter, C.K., a K-9 officer with the Florida Department of Transportation, arrived and utilized his K-9 to perform an exterior search of C.L.’s vehicle. The K-9 alerted on the driver's door of C.L.’s vehicle and a subsequent search of the interior of the vehicle revealed small bag containing approximately four grams of marijuana, a ten ml vial labeled “testosterone” and approximately seven smaller vials labeled “Omnadren.” C.L. told Deputy RS. that he had a prescription for the  “testosterone,” but stated that he purchased the “Ommnadren” on the internet.  ' C.L.’s mother is a former employee of Respondent.  38160  Deputy R.S. arrested CL. for possession of the “testosterone” and “Omnadren” without a prescription and possession of marijuana and booked him into the Baker County Detention Center (BCDC). According to Deputy R.S., the labels on the vials of “testosterone” and “Omnadren” did not contain the information typically found on prescription medication, including the name and birthday of the individual who received the prescription, the name of the prescribing physician and the name of the dispensing pharmacy.  29. Testerone and Omnadren are anabolic-androgenic steroids. Anabolic- androgenic steroids are steroid compounds, including testosterone and its synthetic relatives that possess anabolic and androgenic effects. Anabolics have the effect of building lean muscle mass, and androgens express male secondary sexual characteristics. Steroid users consume anabolic-androgenic steroids for their  ) anabolic effects, but the androgenic effects are generally responsible for adverse reactions. Common adverse reactions include profound effects on the cardiovascular system, the liver, the musculoskeletal system, the hematological system, and the male and female reproductive systems. Several studies have also reported an association between anabolic-androgenic steroids and serious  psychological problems, including psychosis, mania, hyperaggressiveness, and  > The contents of the this vial were later identified as “Sustanon,” which is a trade name for a combination of four testosterone-based compounds that is not legally available in the United States and is not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for treatment of any conditions.  38161_  a3  dependency.  30. According to Section 893.03(3), Florida Statutes (2010-2011), anabolic steroids are Schedule III controlled substances that have a potential for abuse less than the substances contained in Schedules I and II. However, abuse of Schedule II substances may lead to moderate or low physical dependence or high psychological dependence, or, in the case of anabolic steroids, may lead to physical damage. ,  31. Upon his release from BCDC, C.L. went to the home of V.A., advised her that he had been arrested for possession of steroids and asked her for  | assistance in having the charges dismissed and having the steroids released from the Sheriff’ s Department. V.A. spoke with Respondent and then directed C.L. to go to Respondent’s office. Upon arriving at Respondent’s office, C.L. entered the exam room used by L.D. L.D., A.S. and Respondent entered the room and C.L.  | explained to Respondent that he had been arrested for possession of steroids, including Sustanon. C.L. lied to Respondent and stated that Sustanon was legal to possess and utilize. C.L. also stated that if he could show the State Attorney that he had a prescription for Sustanon, then the State Attorney would dismiss the possession charge.  32. Respondent initially instructed V.A. to research a medical condition  called gynecomastia (benign enlargement of the male breast) and to research  33162  14  This Final Order shall take effect upon being filed with  the Clerk of the Department of Health.

Cosduu  Deputy Agency Clerk Sustanon, including what it is, what it does, and how it is to be prescribed. However, V.A. had to leave the clinic to see patients at Macclenny Nursing and Respondent instructed L.D. to complete the research. Respondent also instructed LD. to generate a medical record for C.L. pertaining to treatment for gynecomastia and backdate that record so that it appeared that Respondent had been treating C.L. on an ongoing basis.  . 33. L.D. researched Sustanon and determined that it is used as an estrogen blocker and is commonly utilized by weightlifters L.D. subsequently created a medical record that indicated C.L. was seen at Respondent’s clinic on Saturday, January 8, 2011, a date on which the clinic was closed. The contents of the medical record stated that C.L. came into the clinic and explained that he was “growing breasts” as a result of working out. The medical record also contains a lengthy explanation regarding gyencomastia and the use of tamoxifen (an estrogen blocker) and Sustanon to treat that condition. L:D. cut-and-pasted this explanation from the internet. The medical record further states that Respondent prescribed Sustanon 300 mg/1 cc, injected intramuscularly once per week, to C.L. Dr. Scarborough reviewed the medical record and advised L.D. what information to add or delete from it. ,  34. Respondent also directed his staff to generate a prescription for  Sustanon as though he had prescribed it to C.L. Respondent normally issued  38163  15 electronically-generated prescriptions, but A.S. handwrote the Sustanon prescription because she could not locate Sustanon in any of the drug databases at the clinic. Respondent signed the prescription.  35. CLL. returned to Respondent’s office on or about April 7, 2011, and L.D. handed him the handwritten prescription for Sustanon, which was dated April 5, 2011, and a patient record that fraudulently documented treatment that never occurred. V.A. and other staff overheard Respondent tell C.L. that he could “get into trouble” or. lose his medical license if anyone found out what he had done. C.L. provided copies of these documents to his attorney who provided them to the State Attorney. The State Attorney dropped the steroid possession charges against C.L. and had the Baker County Sheriff's Department release the Sustanon to C.L.  36. On or about September 30, 2011, C.L. stated, under oath, to FDLE Agents that he was not seen at the clinic on January 8, 2011 and that he purchased the Sustanon from “someone in Georgia.” |  _ COUNT I  37.

SCARBOROUGH, MLD.,  RESPONDENT. /  ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLAINT  COMES NOW, Petitioner, Department of Health, by and through its undersigned counsel, and files this Administrative Complaint before the Board of Medicine against the Respondent, CHARLES D. SCARBOROUGH, M_D., and in support thereof alleges:  1. Petitioner is the state department charged with regulating the practice of medicine pursuant to Section 20.43, Florida Statutes (2010-2011); Chapter 456, Florida Statutes (2010-2011); and Chapter 458, Florida Statutes (2010-2011).  2. At all times material to this Complaint, Respondent was a licensed physician within the State of Florida, having been issued license number ME  18474. .  38149__  3. At all times material to this Complaint, owned and operated a family practice medical clinic (the clinic) in Macclenny, Florida, but was not board certified in any specialty.  4. _Respondent’s address of record is 31 South Fifth Street, Macclenny, Florida 32063. ,  5. | Respondent employs both licensed registered nurses and untrained staff at the clinic. This staff includes: A.S. and T.D., who possess licenses to practice as registered nurses in the State of Florida; and L.D., V.A. and C.A., who possess no healthcare licenses and little-to-no medical training.  Treatment of Patients by A.S.  6. A.S. has worked for Respondent for about one year. She is a licensed registered nurse in the State of Florida and has been for approximately 15 years. A.S.’s duties at the clinic include documenting patients’ vitals signs and chief complaints, reviewing patients’ medical histories and addressing any problems they may have. In certain situation, A.S. determines which medications should be prescribed to patients and enters this information in the computer system before Respondent sees patients. These situations include those when patients have no changes in their conditions. A.S. spends approximately ten to twenty minutes with each patient she sees, while Respondent spends five to ten minutes with each  patient. She typically sees between 13 and 17 patients per day. A.S. also obtains  38150 refills of her husband’s medication without her husband seeing Respondent and , sometimes without generating medical records for the refills. Treatment of Patients by L.D.  7. L.D. worked for Respondent from January 2010 through August 2011, as a “medical technician,” but possessed no type of healthcare licensure. L.D. has an Associate of Arts degree and an Associate of Science degree in legal studies. She claims to have completed a two-week classroom program to become a certified nursing assistant (CNA) and worked under supervision at St. Luke’s Hospital in Jacksonville, Florida, but she left the program before she earned her licensure. According to L.D., Respondent treated his unlicensed staff as nurse practitioners working under his direction and referred to them as “nurses” and the patients believed the employees were all licensed nurses.  8. L.D. was assigned her own exam room at Respondent’s clinic. Her duties primarily consisted of checking patients’ blood pressure and pulse, documenting patients’ complaints or reasons for their visits, reviewing patients’ current medications and test results and recommending treatment, dosages and medication adjustments based on test results. L.D. typically entered prescriptions into the clinic’s electronic database, after she made prescribing decisions, so that staff could print the prescriptions and have Respondent: sign them. Sometimes  L.D. saw multiple patients, including sets of friends or family members, at the  38151  same time. Dr. Scarborough met with patients in L.D.’s examination room, but only examined about half of the patients. It was especially common for Respondent not to examine all of the patients when multiple patients were present in L.D.’s exam room at the same time.  9. On some occasions, L.D. prescribed medications without Respondent examining patients or Respondent took action based only on L.D.’s interpretation of lab results or her summary of the patients’ complaints. In a sworn interview with Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) agents, L.D. referred to Respondent “seeing [her] patients” as though she had her own set of patients.. L.D. also described Respondent as “‘slow”’ in his treatment of patients and stated that he would “skip a few corners.” The length of time that Respondent spent with “L.D.’s patients” depended on each patient’s situation.  10. L.D. administered injections, including Vitamin B12 injections, to patients at the clinic. Respondent instructed L.D. and other employees to inject’ the patients as required, . However, L.D. admitted that her CNA training never . included instructions on how to administer injections and Respondent never taught her how to do so either.  Treatment of Patients by V.A. 11. V.A. began working for Respondent in October 2003 as a  receptionist. Since then, she has also worked as the office manager of the clinic  38152",2013,FL

Section 458.331(1)(t)1, Florida Statutes (2007, 2008, 2009), subject’s a doctor to discipline for committing medical Malpractice as defined in Section 456.50, Florida Statutes (2007, 2008, 2009), which provides that the failure to practice medicine in accordance with the level of care, skill, and treatment recognized in general law related to health care licensure. For purposes of Section 458.331(1)(t)1, Florida Statutes (2007, 2008, 2009), the Board shall give great weight to the provisions of Section 766.102, Florida Statutes (2007, 2008, 2009), which provide that the prevailing professional standard of care fora given health care provider shall be that level of care, skill, and treatment which, in light of all relevant ‘surrounding circumstances, is recognized as acceptable and appropriate by reasonably prudent similar health care providers.  197. Rule 64B8-9.013, Florida Administrative Code (F.A.C.), which is  . part of the chapter of the Florida Administrative Code where the Board of  57  Medicine establishes standards of care for physicians, provides in relevant part:  64B8-9.013 Standards for the Use of Controlled Substances for the Treatment of Pain. (1) Pain management principles.  (a) The Board of Medicine recognizes that principles of quality medical practice dictate that the people of the State of Florida have access to appropriate and effective pain relief. The  _ appropriate application of up-to-date knowledge and treatment  ' modalities can serve to improve the quality of life for those patients who suffer from pain as well as reduce the morbidity and costs associated with untreated or inappropriately treated pain. The Board encourages — physicians - to view effective pain management as a part of quality medical practice for all patients with pain, acute or chronic, and it is especially important for patients who experience pain as a result of terminal illness: All physicians should become knowledgeable about effective methods of pain treatment as well as statutory requirements for prescribing controlled. substances.  * : *  (b) The Board recognizes that controlled substances, including opioid analgesics, may be essential in the treatment of acute pain due to trauma or surgery and chronic pain, whether due to cancer or non-cancer origins. The medical management of pain including intractable pain should be based on current knowledge and research and indudes the use of both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic modalities. Pain should be assessed and treated promptly, and the quantity and frequency of doses should be adjusted according to the intensity and duration of the pain. Physicians. should recognize that tolerance and physical dependence are normal consequences of sustained use of opioid analgesics and are not synonymous with addiction.  (c) The Board of Medicine is obligated under the laws of the State of Florida to protect the public health and safety. The Board recognizes that inappropriate prescribing of controlled substances, including opioid analgesics, may lead to drug diversion and abuse by individuals who seek them for other than legitimate medical  58  use. Physicians should be diligent in preventing the diversion of drugs for illegitimate purposes. .  (d) The Board will consider — prescribing, ordering, administering, or dispensing controlled substances for pain to be for a‘legitimate medical purpose if based on accepted scientific knowledge of the treatment of pain or if based on sound clinical grounds. All such prescribing must be based on clear documentation of unrelieved pain and in compliance with applicable state or federal law. . :  (e) Each case of prescribing for pain will be evaluated on an individual basis. The Board will not take disciplinary action against a physician for failing to adhere strictly to the provisions of these standards, if good cause is shown for such deviation. The physician’s conduct will be evaluated to a great extent by the treatment outcome, taking into account whether the drug used is medically and/or pharmacologically recognized to be appropriate for the diagnosis, the patient’s individual needs including any improvement in functioning, and recognizing that some types of pain cannot be completely relieved.  __ (f) The Board will judge the validity of prescribing based on the physician’s ‘treatment of : the. patient and on available documentation, rather than on the quantity and chronicity of prescribing. The goal is: to control the patient's pain for its duration while effectively addressing other aspects of the patient's functioning, including physical, psychological, social, and work- related factors. The following standards are not intended to define complete or best practice, but rather to communicate what the Board considers to be within the boundaries of professional  practice. * * *  (2) Standards, The Board has adopted the following standards for the use of controlled substances for pain control:  (a) Evaluation of the Patient. A complete medical history and physical examination must be conducted and documented in the medical record. The medical record should document the nature and intensity of the pain, current and past treatments for pain, -undeflying or coexisting diseases or conditions, the effect of the pain on physical and psychological function, and history of substance abuse. The medical record also should document the  59 12-08-16;13:06 ;From: To: 18132292254 ; # 5/ 7  filed.

(b) Treatment Plan. The written treatment plan should state objectives that will be used to determine treatment success, such as pain rellef and improved physical and psychosocial function, and should indicate if any further diagnostic evaluations or other treatments are planned. After treatment begins, the physician should adjust drug therapy to the individual medical needs of each patient. Other treatment. modalities or a rehabilitation program may be necessary depending on the etiology of the pain and the extent to which the pain is’ associated with physical and psychosocial impairment...  . -  (c) Informed Consent and Agreement for Treatment. The physician should discuss the risks-and_ benefits of the use of controlled substances with the patient, persons designated by the _ patient, or with the patient’s surrogate or guardian if the patient is incompetent. The patient should receive prescriptions from one physician and one pharmacy where possible. If the patient is determined to be at high risk for medication abuse or have a history of substance abuse, the physician should employ the use of a written agreement between physician and patient outlining patient responsibilities, including, but not Jimited to:  1. Urine/serum medication levels screening when requested; .  2. Number and frequency of all prescription refills; and . OO _  3. Reasons for which drug therapy. may be discontinued (i.e., violation of agreement). )  (d) Periodic Review. At reasonable intervals based on the ~  individual circumstances of the patient, the physician should review the course of treatment and any new information about the etiology of the pain. Continuation or modification of therapy  should depend on the physician’s evaluation of the patient’s .  progress. If treatment goals are not being achieved, despite medication adjustments, the physician. should reevaluate the appropriateness of continued treatment. The physician should monitor patient compliance in medication usage and related treatment plans. ;  (e) Consultation. The physician should be willing to refer the patient as necessary for additional evaluation and treatment in  60 order to achieve treatment objectives. Special attention should be given to those pain patients who are at risk for misusing their medications and those whose living arrangements pose a risk for medication misuse or diversion. The management of pain in patients with a history of substance abuse or with a comorbid psychiatric disorder requires extra care, monitoring, .and documentation, and may require consultation with or referral to an expert in the management of such patients.  (f) Medical Records. The physician is required to keep accurate and complete records to include, but not be limited to:  1. The medical history and physical examination, including  history of drug abuse or dependence, as appropriate;  2. Diagnostic, therapeutic, and laboratory results;  3. Evaluations and consultations; —  4. Treatment objectives; .  5. Discussion of risks and benefits;  ‘6. Treatments;  7. Medications (including date, type, dosage, and quantity  prescribed);  8. Instructions and agreements; and  9. Periodic reviews. Records must remain current and be maintained in an accessible manner and readily available for review. .  (g) Compliance with Controlled Substances Laws and Regulations. To prescribe, dispense, or administer controlled substances, the physician must be licensed in the state and  ~ comply with applicable federal and state regulations. Physicians  are referred to the Physicians Manual: An Informational Outline of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, published by the U.S. Drug  Enforcement Agency, for specific rules governing controlled  substances as well as applicable state regulations.  198.

CASE NO. 2013-13950  MARIO ALBERTO DIAZ, M.D.,  RESPONDENT. /  ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLAINT  Petitioner Department of Health files this Administrative Complaint  before the Board of Medicine against Respondent Mario Alberto Diaz, M.D., and in support thereof alleges:  1. Petitioner is the state agency charged with regulating the practice of medicine pursuant to Section 20.43, Florida Statutes; Chapter 456, Florida Statutes; and Chapter 458, Florida Statutes.  2. At all times material to this Complaint, Respondent was a licensed physician within the state of Florida, having been issued license number ME39292.  3. Respondent's address of record is 10120 SW 81 Street, Miami,  Florida 33173.  ~~ 3817 4. On August 12, 2013, Patient L.P, an is-year old female, presented to Coral Gables Cosmetic Center in Miami, Florida, for a bilateral augmentation mammoplasty. Respondent provided anesthesia services for the procedure.  5. Prior to the beginning of the procedure, Respondent proceeded with the induction of anesthesia and inserted a Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA) in order to ensure a secure airway during the procedure.  6. | The procedure was completed uneventfully and the anesthesia gases were turned off and L.P. was provided 100% oxygen.  7. Five minutes after the end of the procedure, L.P. started developing bradycardia and hypotension. Her breathing was very slow and required assistance by Respondent with a breathing bag.  8. | L.P’s cardiovascular changes progressed to the point where Respondent administered atropine and then, a few minutes later, ephedrine, in an effort to increase her heart rate and blood pressure. Respondent also. started chest compressions on L.P. after the administration of atropine.  9, When there was no response to the administration of atropine and ephedrine, Respondent administered epinephrine in order to increase  respiration, heart rate, and blood pressure.  DOH VS. MARIO ALBERTO DIAZ, M.D, CASE NO, 2013-13950 2  581 10. Respondent's efforts to resuscitate L.P, lasted for over thirty minutes, and eventually L.P. stabilized; however, she was not waking up, and, one hour after the end of the surgery, Respondent directed that EMT services were called to transport L.P. to a nearby hospital.  11. Respondent converted L.P’s LMA to an endotracheal tube for airway management during her transfer to the hospital.  12. L.P was admitted to Mercy Hospital where it was determined she had suffered severe anoxic encephalopathy.  13. The prevailing standard of care required Respondent to maintain and support patient’s blood pressure and vital signs throughout the anesthetic case.  14. L.P’s hypotension needed to be addressed in a rapid and timely manner. Respondent should have administered vasopressors in a more aggressive and timely fashion, including the earlier administration of epinephrine and the use of norepinephrine, vasopressin and fluids.  15. Respondent failed to convert L.P’s LMA to an endotracheal tube during what was a prolonged resuscitation, creating a situation wherein after Respondent initiated chest compressions he would have been unable  to also ventilate L.P. with a breathing bag.  DOH VS. MARIO ALBERTO DIAZ, M.D. CASE NO. 2013-13950 3  5819 16. Section 458.331(1)(t)1., Florida Statutes (2013), subjects a medical doctor to discipline by the Board of Medicine for committing medical malpractice as defined in Section 456.50. Section 456.50, Florida — Statutes (2013), defines medical malpractice as the failure to practice medicine in accordance with the level of care, skill, and treatment recognized in general law related to health care licensure. The level of care, skill, and treatment recognized in general law related to health care licensure means the standard of care specified in Section 766.102. Section 766.102(1), Florida Statutes (2013), defines the standard of care to mean “ |. The prevailing professional standard of care for a given health care provider shall be that level of care, skill, and treatment which, in light of all relevant surrounding circumstances, is recognized as acceptable and appropriate by reasonably prudent similar health care providers. . . .”  17. Respondent failed to meet the prevailing standard of care in regard to Patient L.P. in one or more of the following ways:  a. By falling to timely and aggressively manage L.P’s severe hypotension with aggressive vasopressor use and fluid  administration; and,  DOH VS, MARIO ALBERTO DIAZ, M.D, CASE NO. 2013-13950 4  eS 7) | b. By failing to convert the LMA to an endotracheal tube with positive pressure ventilation during a prolonged resuscitation | event.  18. Based on the foregoing, Respondent has violated Section 458.331(1)(t)1., Florida Statutes (2013), by committing medical malpractice In his care of L.P.  WHEREFORE, the Petitioner respectfully requests that the Board of  Medicine enter an order imposing one or more of the following penalties:  permanent revocation or suspension of Respondent's license, restriction of practice, imposition of an administrative fine, issuance of a reprimand, ~ placement of the Respondent on probation, corrective action, refund of fees billed or collected, remedial education and/or any other relief that the  Board deems appropriate.

TRAIGER, M.D.,  RESPONDENT. /  ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLAINT  Petitioner Department of Health files this Administrative Complaint before the Board of Medicine against Respondent Dean S. Traiger, M.D., and in support thereof alleges:  1. Petitioner is the state agency charged with regulating the practice of medicine pursuant to Section 20.43, Florida Statutes; Chapter 456, Florida Statutes; and Chapter 458, Florida Statutes.  2. At all times material to this Complaint, Respondent was a licensed physician within the State of Florida, having been issued license number ME 79844.  3. Respondent's address of record is 1304 South East 8th Terrace,  Cape Coral, Florida 33990. 4. Respondent is Board Certified by the American Board of Family Medicine in the field of Family Medicine.  9. Patient J.D. presented to Respondent on or about January 12, 2012, with complaints of sudden-onset testicular pain, increased urinary frequency, and nausea.  6. At this office visit, J.D. informed Respondent that his symptoms had begun that morning, and that his pain was concentrated in his right testicle.  7. Respondent examined J.D. and noted that J.D/s right testicle was enlarged and firm. Respondent also noted tenderness and swelling in the epididymis! of the right testicle.  8. Given J.D.’s presenting symptoms, the standard of care required Respondent to definitively determine whether or not J.D. had a testicular torsion.’  9. Respondent failed to definitively determine whether J.D. had a  testicular torsion.  ' A tightly-colled, tubular structure within the scrotum that connects the testicle to the vas deferens.  * The medically significant twisting of the spermatic cord. The spermatic cord brings blood to the scrotum and testicles. Twisting the spermatic cord can cut off this blood flow. Testicular torsion is characterized by sudden onset of pain in the testicle(s), enlargement and firming of one or both testicles, tenderness and swelling of the epididymis, and nausea and/or vomiting. Testicular torsion is a urologic emergency, requiring immediate referral to an emergency room or a urologist equipped to perform outpatient surgery. Delay in diagnosis of a testicular torsion dramatically decreases the likelihood of saving the affected testicle(s). 10. Instead, diagnosed J.D. with epididymitis;?> and prescribed Levofloxacin’ to combat infection, and Naproxen’ to reduce J.D/'s pain and inflammation.  ii. If it was unclear to Respondent whether J.D. had epididymitis or a testicular torsion, the standard of care required Respondent to refer J.D. to a urologist, emergency room, or ultrasound facility to definitively determine the cause of J.D.’s symptoms.  12. Respondent did not refer J.D. to a urologist, emergency room, or ultrasound facility to definitively determine the cause of J.D.’s symptoms.  13. On or about January 17, 2012, J.D. returned to Respondent's office for a previously scheduled, annual physical examination.  14. At this examination, J.D. reported continued soreness in his right testicle.  15. Given J.D.'s continuing symptoms, the standard of care required Respondent to definitively determine whether or not J.D. had a testicular  torsion.  > Epididymitis is a medical term used to describe pain or discomfort in the epididymis caused by inflammation. It is characterized by swelling and discoloration of the testicle(s), and it is most commonly caused by bacterlal Infection. Epididymitis is normally treated by correcting the underlying cause of the inflammation, In the case of a bacterial infection, this is accomplished through an antibiotic treatment regime, and Inflammation and pain management.  * A broad-spectrum antibiotic used to combat bacterial infections.  * A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug used to reduce pain and inflammation.  3 16. Respondent again failed to definitively determine whether or not J.D. with a testicular torsion.  17. If it was still unclear to Respondent whether J.D. had epididymitis or a testicular torsion, the standard of care required Respondent to refer J.D. to a urologist, emergency room, or ultrasound facility to definitively determine the cause of J.D,’s symptoms.  18. Respondent again failed to refer J.D. a urologist, emergency room, or ultrasound facility to definitively determine the cause of J.D/s symptoms.  19. Respondent instead recommended the use a jockstrap to provide additional support to the testicles.  20. On or about January 23, 2012, Respondent spoke to J.D. on the telephone, and J.D. reported that his symptoms had not improved. J.D. also reported that his right testicle was now a solid, hard lump.  21. Given J.D.'s continued and exacerbated symptoms, the standard of care required Respondent to immediately refer J.D. to a urologist, emergency room, or ultrasound facility.  22. Respondent failed to immediately refer J.D. to a urologist,  emergency room, or ultrasound facility. 23. Instead, Respondent offered an ultrasound appointment on or about January 24, 2012. J.D. was unavailable for an ultrasound at this date.  24. J.D. was eventually given an ultrasound on or about January 31, 2012.  25. The ultrasound that occurred on or about January 31, 2012, revealed that there was no blood flow to J.D.'s right testicle.  26. The ultrasound results were relayed to Respondent, who then referred J.D. to Urologist H.T.  27. Urologist H.T. diagnosed J.D. with a testicular torsion of the right testicle.  28. Due to the delay in diagnosing J.D.’'s testicular torsion, J.D's right testicle could not be saved.  29. J.D/s right testicle was removed during exploratory surgery, on or about February 9, 2012.  30. Section 458.331(1)(t), Florida Statutes (2011), subjects a licensee to discipline for committing medical malpractice as defined in  Section 456.50(1)(g), Florida Statutes. 31. Section 456.50(1)(g), Florida Statutes (2011), states medical ' malpractice means the failure to practice medicine in accordance with the level of care, skill, and treatment recognized in general law related to health care licensure.  32. Section 766.102, Florida Statutes (2011), provides that the prevailing standard of care for a given healthcare provider shall be that level of care, skill, and treatment which, in light of all relevant surrounding circumstances, is recognized as acceptable and appropriate by reasonably prudent similar health care providers.  33. Respondent fell below the minimum standard of care in his treatment of Patient J.D. in one or more of the following ways:  a. By failing to definitively determine whether or not J.D. had a testicular torsion of his right testicle, when J.D. presented at the initial examination, which occurred on or about January 12, 2012:  b. By failing to refer J.D. to a urologist, emergency room, or ultrasound facility to definitively determine the cause of J.D’s symptoms, following the initial examination, which occurred  on or about January 12, 2012; c. By failing to definitively determine whether or not J.D. with a testicular torsion of his right testicle, when J.D. presented at the annual medical examination, which occurred on or about January 17, 2012;  d. By failing to refer J.D. to a urologist, emergency room, or ultrasound facility to definitively determine the cause of J.D.'s symptoms, following the annual medical examination, which occurred on or about January 17, 2012; and/or  e. By failing to immediately refer J.D. to a urologist, emergency room, or ultrasound facility after J.D. reported his continuing and exacerbated symptoms on or about January 23, 2012.  34. Based on the foregoing, Respondent violated Section 458.331(1)(0), Florida Statutes (2011).  WHEREFORE, the Petitioner respectfully requests that the Board of Medicine enter an order imposing one or more of the following penalties: permanent revocation or suspension of Respondent’s license, restriction of practice, imposition of an administrative fine, issuance of a reprimand,  placement of the Respondent on probation, corrective action, refund of fees billed or collected, remedial education and/or any other relief that the  Board deems appropriate.

Respondent's address of record is 6788 NW 117"" Avenue,  Parkland, Florida 33076.  24379  4. By a Second Superseding Indictment filed on July 19, 2012, in Case No. 10-80149-CR-Marra/Hopkins(S)(S), in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Respondent was charged with multiple counts of violations of the United States Code related to her practice at American Pain Clinic (American Pain) located at 5801 N. Federal Highway, Boca Raton, Florida, and thereafter at 1200 North Dixie Highway, Lake Worth, Florida. See the Second Superseding Indictment attached as Exhibit A. ,  5. Among other allegations, Count 13 re-alleged the General Allegations section and the Manner and Means of the Conspiracy section of Count 1 and expressly incorporated them in Count 13.  6. Count 13 then specifically charged Respondent as follows:  Beginning in or about 2007 and continuing to in or about April 2010, the exact dates being unknown, in the Southern District of Florida, and elsewhere, the defendants,  Cynthia Cadet, M.D. and Joseph Castronuovo, M.D.  knowingly and willfully combined, conspired, confederated, and agreed with each other and with other persons known and unknown to the Grand Jury, to commit certain offenses against the United States, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1957, that is to knowingly engage and attempt to engage in monetary transactions by, through, or to a financial institution, affecting interstate and foreign commerce, in criminally derived property of a value greater than $10,000, such property having been derived from a specified unlawful activity.  DOH v. Cynthia Maley Cadet, M.D. : 2 DOH Case No. 2011-13720 24380  It is further alleged that the specified unlawful activity is the distribution, dispensing and possession with intent to distribute and dispense, oxycodone, a Schedule II narcotic controlled substance, outside the scope of professional practice and not for a legitimate medical purpose, in violation of Title 21, United States Code, Section 841(a)(1). ,  All in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1956(h).  7. Respondent was convicted by jury verdict of violating Count 13 of the Second Superseding Indictment.  8. The Offenses charged in Count 13 are otherwise commonly referred to as “money laundering.”  9. While Count 13 does not charge Respondent directly with having engaged in distribution, dispensing and possession with intent to distribute and dispense, oxycodone, a Schedule JI narcotic controlled substance, outside the scope of professional practice and not for a legitimate medical purpose, it does charge Respondent with knowingly and willfully engaging in a conspiracy to launder money obtained from the specified unlawful activity of distribution, dispensing and possession with intent to distribute and dispense, oxycodone, a Schedule II narcotic controlled substance, outside the scope of professional practice and not for  a legitimate medical purpose.  DOH v. Cynthia Maley Cadet, M.D. 3 DOH Case No. 2011-13720 2119  20. Based on the foregoing, Respondent violated Section  458.331(1)(t)1., Florida Statutes (2008). Section 458.331(1)(q), Florida Statutes  21. Section 458.331(1)(q), Florida Statutes (2008), subjects a licensee to discipline for prescribing, dispensing, administering, mixing, or otherwise preparing a legend drug, including any controlled substance, other than in the course of the physician's professional practice, For the purposes of the paragraph, it shall be legally presumed that prescribing, dispensing, administering, mixing, or otherwise preparing legend drugs, including all controlled substances, inappropriately or in excessive or inappropriate quantities is not in the best interest of the patient and is not in the course of the physician's professional practice, without regard to his or her intent.  Count II Violation of Section 458.331(1)(q), Florida Statutes  22. Petitioner realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 17 and paragraph 21 as if fully set forth herein.  23. Respondent prescribed a legend drug other than in the course of her professional practice by inappropriately prescribing controlled  substances to TG.  DOH v. Cynthia Cadet, M.D., Case Number 2009-15100 7  24381  10. More particularly, Respondent knowingly conspired to launder money which was criminally derived from, distribution, dispensing and possession with intent to distribute and dispense, oxycodone, a Schedule II narcotic controlled substance, outside the scope of professional practice and not for a legitimate medical purpose.  11. Count 13, for which Respondent was convicted, on its face, is a crime that is directly related to the practice of medicine and is a crime that is related to the practice of medicine.  12. Paragraph 45 of the Manner and Means of the Conspiracy section of Count 1, which was re-alleged in Count 13, specifically alleges that the co-conspirators at American Pain (which included Respondent) “would maintain cash generated through the distribution and dispensing of controlled substances in trash bags in the clinics. Such trash bags filled with cash would then be deposited at various financial institutions.”  13. The reasonable inference is that at least some of that cash is the money that Respondent was convicted of laundering. |  14. Respondent’s willingness to be a party to the money laundering of money that was derived from distribution, dispensing and possession with intent to distribute and dispense, oxycodone, a Schedule II narcotic  controlled substance, outside the scope of professional practice and not for  DOH v. Cynthia Maley Cadet, M.D. 4 DOH Case No, 2011-13720 . 24382  a legitimate medical purpose is a crime directly related to the practice of medicine or is a crime related to the practice of medicine.  15. Count 13, for which Respondent was convicted, on Its face, is also a crime which is directly related to Respondent's ability to practice medicine or a crime that is related to the practice of medicine because she was willing to engage in a scheme to knowingly launder money that was derived from distribution, dispensing and possession with intent to distribute and dispense, oxycodone, a Schedule II narcotic controlled substance, outside the scope of professional practice and not for a legitimate medical purpose.  16. The Respondent was convicted by a jury and was adjudicated guilty of the violation set forth in Count 13 and quoted above. That crime, as stated, is a crime that relates to the ability to practice medicine. The qualities essential to the practice of medicine include reliability, honesty, and good moral character. The crime for which the Respondent was convicted and was adjudicated guilty demonstrates that the Respondent lacks these essential qualities. By demonstrating that the Respondent lacks these essential qualities, the Respondent's crime relates to her ability  to practice medicine by showing that she is not worthy to be entrusted  DOH v. Cynthia Maley Cadet, M.D. 5 DOH Case No, 2011-13720 24383  with the privileges and authority vested in those who are licensed to practice medicine.  17.

In Case No. 10-80149-CR-Marra/Hopkins(S)(S), Respondent was convicted of and adjudicated guilty of a crime that relates to the practice of medicine or the ability to practice medicine as further described in paragraphs 4-16 above.  19. Based on the foregoing, Respondent has violated Section 456.072(1)(c), Florida Statutes (2007-2009), by being convicted or found guilty of, or entering a plea of nolo contendere to, regardless of adjudication, a crime in any jurisdiction which relates to the practice of medicine or to the ability to practice medicine.  WHEREFORE, the Petitioner respectfully requests that the Board of Medicine enter an order imposing one or more of the following penalties: permanent revocation or suspension of Respondent's license, restriction of  practice, imposition of an administrative fine, issuance of a reprimand,  DOH v.

Petitioner is the state department charged with regulating the practice of medicine pursuant to Section 20.43, Florida Statutes; Chapter 456, Florida Statutes; and Chapter 458, Florida Statutes.  2. At all times material to this Complaint, Respondent was a licensed physician within the state of Florida, having been Issued license number ME 87491.  3, | Respondent’s address of record is 104 Valrico Station Road,  Apt. 102, Valrico, Florida, 33594.  STIPULATED FACTS  1. At all times material hereto, Respondent was a licensed physician in the State of Florida having been issued license number ME 87491.  2. The Department charged Respondent with Administrative Complaints that were filed and properly served upon Respondent alleging violations of Chapters 456 and 458, Florida Statutes, and the rules adopted pursuant thereto. True and correct copies of the Administrative Complaints are attached hereto as Exhibit A.  3. For purposes of these proceedings, Respondent neither admits nor denies the allegations of fact contained in the Administrative Complaints.  STIPULATED CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  1.

When Respondent terminated his medical practice he abandoned medical records in his former office that are now in the possession of his former landlord.  6. Respondent did not provide notice to his patients of the termination of his medical practice. |  7. Respondent did not place an advertisement in the local newspaper indicating that he was terminating his practice and offering patients the opportunity to obtain a copy of their medical records.  8. Respondent did not inform the Board of Medicine that he was terminating his practice and no longer available to patients.  9. Respondent did not inform the Board of Medicine of any new owner of the medical records and where the medical records can be found.  10. Patient C.W. (C.W.) was Respondent's patient from January 2012 until October 2013.  11. On or about January 24, 2012, C.W. underwent allergy skin testing by Respondent and was diagnosed with allergies to trees, weeds,  grasses, molds, and dust mites.  DOH VS. DANIEL TODD GRIFFITH, M.D. CASE NO. 2014-00206 2  12, On or about January 30, 2012, C.W. began receiving allergy immunotherapy shots weekly from Respondent to treat the diagnosed allergies. The shots continued until on or about October 28, 2013, when Respondent's office closed.  13. Upon the closing of Respondent's office, C.W. presented to Dr.  S.P., an allergist, for evaluation.  14. Dr. S.P. conducted allergy skin testing on C.W. on or about  December 2, 2013. Dr. S.P. determined that the skin testing was negative  1584  for all environmental allergens.  15. Because of the inconsistency of C.W.'s allergy skin testing results with the diagnosis of Respondent, Dr. S.P. ordered blood testing for environmental allergens. On or about December 17, 2013, the blood tests were conducted on C.W., and all were normal according to Dr. S.P. Asa result, Dr. S.P. diagnosed C.W. with non-allergic vasomotor rhinitis.  16. The standard of care for allergy immunotherapy requires positive allergy skin tests with a good positive control.  17. When allergy testing is done a positive and negative control test are used to verify the testing procedure. This ensures that there isn’t an abnormality in the skin causing all tests to be positive. Histamine is  used for the positive as it usually will form a 3+ or 4+ reaction. If  DOH VS. DANIEL TODD GRIFFITH, M.D. CASE NO. 2014-00206 3  1585  histamine does not have this reaction, then any testing done that day will be inaccurate. Saline is used for a negative control.  18. In C,W’s case, the positive control was only a 2+ when a 3+ or 4+ is considered positive. C.W/s results in the skin testing conducted by Respondent indicated that almost all the tests were 2+ with a 2+ positive control. Respondent’s diagnosis was that C.W. was allergic to almost everything for which she was tested; however a 3+ or 4+ control is needed to indicate a positive test, which is not possible when the positive control is only a 2+.  19. Respondent should have had C.W. come back for new controls on another day to ensure accurate testing. She needed to be retested on a day when she had a good histamine control (3+ or 4+) in order to make an appropriate diagnosis.  20. The testing done by Dr. S.P. demonstrates the need for a good positive control for accurate testing because with a good positive histamine control C.W. was negative for all environmental allergens. The blood tests conducted by Dr. S.P. corroborated the negative results of the allergy skin testing.  21. The allergy skin tests conducted by Respondent on C.W, do not  indicate the need for allergy immunotherapy. This is confirmed by Dr. S.P’s  DOH VS, DANIEL TODD GRIFFITH, M.D. CASE NO. 2014-00206 4  13586  evaluation of C.W. Respondent’s diagnosis of allergic rhinitis was not correct: instead, the correct diagnosis was non-allergic vasomotor rhinitis, for which immunotherapy treatment is not appropriate.  22. Respondent practiced below the standard of care by giving allergy immunotherapy shots to C.W. for over a year, when she was not shown to be allergic by either skin or blood testing.  23. On January 16, 2014, C.W. requested her medical records from Respondent by certified mail. ,  24, Respondent did not respond to C.W.’'s request for her medical records.  25. To date, Respondent has not provided C.W. with her records.  COUNTONE —  26.

The Consumer Services Unit is where all complaints against Florida health care licensees (e.g., medical doctors, dentists, nurses, respiratory therapists) are officially filed. | have been in my current job position for more than one year. My business address is 4052 Bald Cypress Way, Bin C-75 Tallahassee, Florida 32399-3275.  As OMCM of the Consumer Services and Compliance Management Unit, my job duties include reviewing data in the Time Tracking System and verifying that the amounts correspond. The Time Tracking System is a computer program which records and tracks DOH’s costs regarding the investigation and prosecution of cases against Florida health care licensees.  As of today, DOH’s total costs for investigating and prosecuting DOH case number(s) 2014-13024 (Department of Health v Victor Manuel Lugo-Martinez) are SEVEN THOUSAND FOUR-HUNDRED THIRTY DOLLARS AND SEVENTY THREE CENTS ($7,430.73).  The costs for DOH case numbers 2014-13024 (Department of Health v. Victor Manuel Lugo- Martinez) are summarized in Exhibit 1 (Cost Summary Report), which is attached to this document.  The itemized costs and expenses for DOH case numbers 2014-13024 (Department of Health v. Victor Manuel Lugo-Martinez) are detailed in Exhibit 2 (Itemized Cost Report and Itemized Expense Report and receipts), which is attached to this document.  The itemized costs as reflected in Exhibit 2 are determined by the  following method: DOH employees who work on cases daily are to keep track of their time in six-minute increments (e.g., investigators  1 of 2  and lawyers). A designated DOH employee in the Consumer Services Unit, Legal Department, and in each area office, inputs the time worked and expenses spent into the Time Tracking System. Time and expenses are charged against a state health care Board (e.g., Florida Board of Medicine, Florida Board of Dentistry, Florida Board of Osteopathic Medicine), and/or a case. If no Board or case can be charged, then the time and expenses are charged as administrative time. The hourly rate of each employee is calculated by formulas established by the Department.

On or about January 21, 2011, the patient presented with complaints of fatigue and continuing cough. The Respondent diagnosed the patient with pneumonia and possible chronic obstructive pulmonary  disease. The Respondent treated the patient with an injection.  Page 4 of 16 24.

The Respondent also had a record for one visit which was not dated.  34. The majority of the Respondent's medical records are unsigned  and do not identify who was treating the patient.  Page 6 of 16  35. In addition to poor record keeping, the Respondent also provided substandard medical care.  36. The standard of care for a new patient is to perform a full physical examination, obtain the patient’s medical history, and to obtain pertinent medical records from the patient’s previous or concurrent healthcare providers,  37. On or about February 22, 2008, the Respondent failed to meet the standard of care by failing to perform an adequate physical examination of P.A. and failing to obtain P.A.’s medical history.  38.

CML is a cancer of the blood in which the bone marrow makes too many while blood cells. CML must be monitored for recurrence and a patient with CML should be treated by a specialist such as a hematologist- oncologist.  41. A reasonably prudent physician would have referred a CML  patient to a hematologist-oncologist immediately. A physician practicing at  Page 7 of 16  the standard of care would have consulted with the patient's hematologist- oncologist and obtained relevant medical records. Finally, a reasonably _ prudent physician would have followed-up with the patient to verify his or her compliance with the referral.  42. On or about February 23, 2008, the Respondent fell below the standard of care by failing to refer the patient to a hematologist-oncologist immediately.  43. Onor about March 13, 2008, and on or about March 27, 2008, the Respondent fell below the standard of care by failing to follow up with P.A.'s physician(s) at Moffitt and the Respondent failed to follow up with the patient to ensure she had been compliant.  44. In the alternative, the Respondent failed to document following up with the patient's physician(s) at Moffitt and she failed to keep medical records provided by those physicians.  45. In or about March 26, 2011, the Respondent referred the patient to an oncologist. The Respondent fell below the standard of care  by failing to follow up with P.A.’s oncologist.  Page 8 of 16  46. In the alternative, the Respondent failed document following up with the patient's oncologist and she failed to keep medical records provided by those physicians.  47. Fatigue, pain, bleeding, and frequent infections and abnormal blood test results are symptoms associated with the recurrence of CML. The standard of care for PA. would have been for the Respondent to recognize that the patient was exhibiting symptoms associated with a recurrence of CML and address CML through treatment or a referral to a hematologist-oncologist.  48. From on or about February 23, 2008, through on or about December 3, 2011, the Respondent failed to recognize and address the patient’s complaints of fatigue, bleeding and frequent infections with a possible recurrence of CML.  49. From on or about February 23, 2008, through December 3, 2011, the Respondent failed to meet the standard of care by treating the patient’s symptoms, rather than recognizing a possible recurrence of CML  and referring the patient to a hematologist-oncologist.

Upon consideration, it is ORDERED: 22003  AFFIDAVIT OF FEES AND COSTS EXPENDED  STATE OF FLORIDA COUNTY OF LEON:  BEFORE ME, the undersigned authority, personally appeared SHANE WALTERS who was sworn and states as follows:  1) My name is Shane Walters.  2) | am over the age of 18, competent to testify, and make this affidavit upon my own personal knowledge and after review of the records at the Florida Department of Health (DOH).  3) | am the Operations and Management Consultant Manager (OMCM) for the Consumer Services and Compliance Management Unit for DOH. The Consumer Services Unit is where all complaints against Florida health care licensees (e.g., medical doctors, dentists, nurses, respiratory therapists) are officially filed. | have been in my current job position for more than one year. My business address is 4052 Bald Cypress Way, Bin C-75 Tallahassee, Florida 32399-3275.  4) As OMCM of the Consumer Services and Compliance Management Unit, my job duties include reviewing data in the Time Tracking System and verifying that the amounts correspond. The Time Tracking System is a computer program which records and tracks DOH’s costs regarding the investigation and prosecution of cases against Florida health care licensees.  5) As of today, DOH’s total costs for investigating and prosecuting DOH case number(s) 2012-16914 (Department of Health v. Cesar Armando Ramirez, M.D.) are FIVE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY- EIGHT DOLLARS AND EIGHTY CENTS ($5,868.80).  6) The costs for DOH case 2012-16914 (Department of Health v. Cesar Armando Ramirez, M.D.) are summarized in Exhibit 1 (Cost Summary Report), which is attached to this document.  7) The itemized costs and expenses for DOH case numbers 2012-16914 (Department of Health v. Cesar Armando Ramirez, M.D.) are detailed in Exhibit 2 (Itemized Cost Report and Itemized Expense Report and receipts), which is attached to this document.  8) The itemized costs as reflected in Exhibit 2 are determined by the  following method: DOH employees who work on cases daily are to keep track of their time in six-minute increments (€.g., investigators  EXHIBIT  1 of 2 : Q 22004  and lawyers). A designated DOH employee in the Consumer Services Unit, Legal Department, and in each area office, inputs the time worked and expenses spent into the Time Tracking System. Time and expenses are charged against a state health care Board (e.g., Florida Board of Medicine, Florida Board of Dentistry, Florida Board of Osteopathic Medicine), and/or a case. If no Board or case can be charged, then the time and expenses are charged as administrative time. The hourly rate of each employee is calculated by formulas established by the Department. (See the Itemized Cost Report)  9) Shane Walters, first being duly sworn, states that she has read the foregoing Affidavit and its attachments and the statements contained therein are true and correct to the best of her knowledge and belief.

As grounds therefore, the Petitioner states the following:  1. At its next regularly scheduled meeting, the Board of Medicine will take up for consideration the above-styled disciplinary action and will enter a Final Order therein.  2. Section 456.072(4), Florida Statutes (2012), states, in pertinent part, as follows:  In addition to any other discipline imposed through final order, or citation, entered on or after July 1,  DOH v.

The costs related to the investigation and prosecution include, but are not limited to, salaries and benefits of personnel, costs related to the time spent by the attorney and other personnel working on the case, and any other expenses incurred by the department for the case. The board, or the department when there is no board, shall determine the amount of costs to be assessed after its consideration of an affidavit of itemized costs and any written objections thereto....  3. As evidenced in the attached affidavit (Exhibit A), the investigation and prosecution of this case has resulted in costs in the total amount of $5,868.80, based on the following itemized statement of costs:  Complaint Cost Summary Complaint Number: 201216914 Subject's Name: RAMIREZ, CESAR ARMANDO  kkkKKK Cost to Date dk kkk [ | Hours ‘| Costs ‘| (Complaint: 2.80 _fs183.72 Investigation: [39.20 ____ |s2,508.02 [Legal: [24.80 [$2,637.56 ; [Compliance: (0.15 [$4.89  yaaadann | [ | bctotetetetoas  Rokatorotenotoono  [Sub Total: 66.95 [$5,304.19 [Expenses to Date: [$564.61  Prior Amount: | [50.00  (Total Costs to Date: || _ |[s5,868.80  DOH v.
