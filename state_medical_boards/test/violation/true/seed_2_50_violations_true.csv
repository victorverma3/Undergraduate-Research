Box 95000, Lakeland, FL 33804-5000.  4. Respondent is board certified in Diagnostic Radiology.  5. On or about February 26, 2011, Patient A.E., an 83 year-old male, fell at home and developed severe and worsening low back pain.  6. On or about March 5 and 8, 2011, MRI's of Patient A.E’s lumbar and thoracic regions revealed a compression fracture with edema: at the T-11 level. ,  7. Patient A.E. was referred to Respondent for a T-11 vertebroplasty. ) ,  8. Vertebroplasty is a spinal procedure where bone cement is injected through a small hole in the skin into a fractured vertebra with the goal of relieving the pain of vertebral compression fractures.  9. On or about March 10, 2011, at The Watson Clinic in Lakeland, Florida, Respondent performed a vertebroplasty at what he believed to be Patient A.E.'s T-11 vertebra. |  10. On or about March 10, 2011, Respondent attempted to  ascertain Patient A.E.’s T-11 vertebra by counting down from a  4132 thoracolumbar kyphosis (over-curvature of the vertebra) at Patient A.E.'s T- 1 vertebra. ,  , 11. Subsequent to Patient A.E.'s discharge, Patient A.E. notified Respondent that he, Patient A.E., was experiencing no improvement in his back pain symptoms. ,  12. On or about March 15, 2011, Patient A.E. underwent an MRI which revealed that Respondent had performed the vertebroplasty at Patient A.E.'s T-12 vertebra (the wrong level).  13. On or about March 16, 2011, Respondent met with Patient A.E. and his family and explained his error, stating that the kyphos at T-1 straightened slightly when Patient A.E. was placed in the prone position changing what appeared to be a fixed landmark which he had used to count to the T-11 level.  14.

On or about March 10, 201 1, Respondent performed a wrong- site procedure by performing a vertebroplasty on Patient A.E. at the T-12 level (wrong site) rather than at the T-11 level (correct site).  18. Based on the foregoing, Respondent has violated Section 456.072(1)(bb), Florida Statutes (2010), by performing or attempting to perform health care services on the wrong patient, a wrong-site procedure, a wrong procedure, or an unauthorized procedure or a procedure that is medically unnecessary or otherwise unrelated to the patient’s diagnosis or medical condition.  WHEREFORE, the Petitioner respectfully requests that the Board of Medicine enter an order imposing one or more of the following penalties:  permanent revocation or suspension of Respondent's license, restriction of  4154 practice, imposition of an administrative fine, issuance of a reprimand, placement of the Respondent on probation, corrective action, refund of fees billed or collected, remedial education and/or any other relief that the  .Board deems appropriate.

CASE NO. 2007-32189 ELISE ROBERTA LEONARD, M.D.,  RESPONDENT. /  ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLAINT  COMES NOW the Petitioner, the Florida Department of Health, by and through its undersigned counsel, and files this Administrative Complaint before the Board of Medicine against Respondent, Elise Roberta Leonard, M.D., and in support thereof alleges:  1. Petitioner is the state department charged with regulating the practice of medicine pursuant to Section 20.43, Florida Statutes; Chapter 456, Florida Statutes; and Chapter 458, Florida Statutes.  2. At all times material to this Complaint, Respondent was a licensed physician within the state of Florida, having been issued license number ME 39592.  3. | Respondent's address of record is 8890 West Oakland Park Blvd., Suite 300, Sunrise, Florida 33351.  J:\PSU\MEDICAL\DAVID PIUS\CASES\LEONARD 07-32189\AC_LEONARD_07-32189.D0C 4, At all times material to this Complaint, Respondent engaged in the practice of medicine as an Ophthalmologist, and is Board Certified in Cataract and Implant Surgery.  5. The Respondent first diagnosed patient W.B., a fifty-two year- old male, with cataracts in both eyes in 2007. The Respondent recommended implanting a new type of intra-ocular lens (IOL), called a Crystalens®, which was expected to correct W.B.’s cataracts and eliminate his need for reading glasses as well. The surgery was performed on W.B.’s left eye on August 7, 2007.  6. After the procedure, W.B. reported improved vision for reading and computer use, but reported that his distance vision was still blurry.  ‘ie Respondent contacted the lens manufacturer, as well as colleagues using the Crystalens® IOL, to discuss why patient W.B. did not have a better result, to determine whether implanting a Crystalens® in the right eye was advisable, and if it was, how to achieve a better result.  8. It was decided that the Respondent would implant a +18.0 diopter Crystalens® in W.B/s right eye, and if there was no posterior vaulting, exchange it for a +19.0 diopter one.  9. Onor about September 11, 2007, patient W.B. was admitted to Foundation For Advanced Eye Care (FFAEC) for the scheduled cataract surgery of his right eye.  J:\PSU\MEDICAL\DAVID PIUS\CASES\LEONARD 07-32189\AC_LEONARD_07-32189.DOC 2 10. The two different powers of Crystalens® were available in the operating room for implantation, with determination of the correct power to be made just prior to implantation.  11. During the surgery Respondent placed the +18.0 diopter lens, completed the surgery, and sent W.B. to the post-anesthesia recovery room (PAR). While he was still in the PAR, the Respondent realized that she had become confused as to the appropriate lens to use given her intraoperative clinical findings, and that the +19.0 diopter lens should have been implanted.  12. The Respondent discussed the error with W.B. while he was still in the PAR and he consented to a return to the operating room so the incorrect +18.0 lens could be removed and the correct +19.0 lens could be implanted. This was done without incident, and W.B. reportedly healed well from the surgery.  13. Section 456.072(1)(bb), Florida Statutes (2007), provides that performing or attempting to perform health care services on the wrong patient, a wrong-site procedure, a wrong procedure, or an unauthorized procedure, or a procedure that is medically unnecessary or otherwise unrelated to the patient's diagnosis or medical condition, constitutes  grounds for discipline by the Board of Medicine.  J:\PSU\MEDICAL\DAVID PIUS\CASES\LEONARD 07-32189\AC_LEONARD_07-32189.DOC 3 14. Respondent inserted a +18.0 diopter lens into patient W.B.‘s right eye instead of the intended +19.0 diopter lens.  15. Based on the foregoing, Respondent violated Section 456.072(1)(bb), Florida Statutes (2007), by performing a wrong procedure.  16. WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that the Board of Medicine enter an order imposing one or more of the following penalties: permanent revocation or suspension of Respondent's license, restriction of practice, imposition of an administrative fine, issuance of a reprimand, placement of Respondent on probation, corrective action and/or any other  relief that the Board deems appropriate.

Petitioner is the state department charged with regulating the practice of medicine pursuant to Section 20.43, Florida Statutes; Chapter 456, Florida Statutes; and Chapter 458, Florida Statutes.  >.

On or about August 7, 2006, Patient G.S., a 54 year-old male, was admitted to Jackson Hospital in Marianna, Florida, with an admitting diagnosis of right hip pain with degenerative joint disease.  5. On or about April 12, 2006, prior Patient G.S.'s admission to | Jackson Hospital, he underwent a CT scan of the right hip, which revealed severely advanced degenerative joint disease in the right hip, with protrusio acetabuli (when the acetabulum (socket) is too deep and may protrude into the pelvis) and severe erosive changes.  6. On or about August 7, 2006, Respondent performed surgery on Patient G.S., who had a preoperative diagnosis of severe osteoporosis and degenerative arthritis of the right hip.  7. The initial consented procedure for the August 7, 2006, surgery on Patient G.S. was a right total arthroplasty (the operative formation or restoration of a joint).  8. After completion of the surgery on August 7, 2006, Dr. Gilmore termed the procedure as a resection hip arthroplasty with assessment right  hip.  32352 _ a  9, There is no documentation in the admitting history and physical for Patient G.S. concerning his osteoporosis and his degenerative arthritis.  10.

Respondent did not describe the findings of the April 12, 2006, CT scan in Patient G.S.’s preoperative assessment.  12. Respondent did not detail the possible complications that might arise as of result of the findings of the April 12, 2006, CT scan.  13. The findings of the April 12, 2006, CT scan were not incorporated into the August 7, 2006, operative report.  14. There is no documentation that Respondent had planned a two stage procedure prior to the August 7, 2006, surgery as a result of the April 12, 2006, right hip CT scan findings.  15.

During the surgery, Respondent evaluated the acetabulum (the cup-shaped socket in the hipbone), and noted that there was a medial wail defect.  18. Respondent also noted during the procedure that there was likely protrusion acetubuli present.  19. Respondent then prepared the socket with an acetabular reamer to establish a peripheral rim fit with a 54 mm 3-hole cup.  20. While reaming the socket, Respondent removed the thin medial wall of the acetabulum.  21. Respondent attempted to obtain purchase of the acetabular implant into the peripheral rim, but was unsuccessful due to the severe nature of Patient G.S.'s osteoporosis and the intra-operative creation of an acetabular non-contained cavitary defect.  22. Respondent decided to abort the procedure in favor of a caged arthroplasty, the equipment for which would have to be custom ordered, and perform a cage procedure to the acetabulum and a cemented femoral stem later in the week.  23. On or about August 9, 2006, Respondent performed a second  right hip arthroscopy, which utilized an anti-protrusio cage prosthesis in the  32354  acetabulum and a cemented polyethylene shell.
