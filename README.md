## Candidate Bios

January 2023 - May 2024

### Abstract

Little is known about the background of the people who run to the U.S. state
legislature. We developed Python software utilizing ChatGPTâ€™s ability to
efficiently summarize large amounts of text in order to compile the biographical
data of nearly 150,000 U.S. state legislator candidates who ran for office
between 1967 and 2017. Specifically, we gathered each candidate's college major,
undergraduate institution, highest degree and institution, and work history.
Prior to this effort, no comprehensive database of such biodata existed at this
scale. Our methodology used the Google Custom Search JSON API to identify
relevant webpages for each candidate, Beautiful Soup and PDF-scraping libraries
to retrieve content, and the OpenAI API to summarize and extract the target
biodata. We found that approximately 40% of all U.S. state legislator candidates
between 1967 and 2017 had biodata available online, with coverage generally
increasing for more recent candidates. LLM hallucinations created some false
positives and false negatives in the final dataset, and some results were lost
due to "prompt errors" (the website context was too long for the OpenAI API) and
"parse errors" (the response was formatted incorrectly). This dataset offers us
unique insights into the background experience and influences of state
legislative candidates and will be used as part of a larger analysis studying
lobbying laws and the revolving door in politics.
